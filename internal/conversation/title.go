Give a short label of two to four words describing what it is about, taken
from what was actually said. Not a summary, not a sentence, not a question.

Reply with the label alone. No quotation marks, no full stop, no preamble, no
explanation, and do not address anyone. If the exchange is too slight to name,
reply with nothing at all.

// something else. "Unarchive" arrived as "unlock". A model that does not know
// where the words came from has no reason to look past them.
//
// The caution at the end is the part that matters. Reading charitably is
// right until a charitable reading destroys something.
//
// Names are carved out of the charity altogether. Everywhere else a word
// that does not fit can be reasoned about from what does; a name cannot,
// because an unfamiliar name and a mangled one are indistinguishable. The
// decoder offered "Alikia", "Alakia" and "alakia chintada" for one name in
// a single evening. Guessing there is how the wrong person gets texted.
