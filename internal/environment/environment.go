// Package provider : Defines the engines that carry out a chat.
//
// A provider is whatever can turn a prompt into an answer: Claude, GPT, a
// local model, or the stub in this package. Which one runs a given chat is a
// routing decision made elsewhere; a chat does not know or care which answered
// it.
//
// A run is a stream rather than a single reply, because an answer can take
// long enough that the user needs to hear something before it arrives.
