// Package platformai : Answers prompts using Zoho Platform AI.
//
// The service is request and response: one call returns one complete answer,
// with nothing in between. The server's Environment interface streams, because a user
// listening through earbuds needs to hear something long before the answer
// arrives. This provider therefore produces its own progress messages while it
// waits, and the service's reply becomes the final one.
