// Package tool holds the things the assistant can do, as against say.
//
// A tool is described in a fixed shape rather than in a paragraph, because
// prose quality cannot be enforced and structure can. The descriptions that
// go wrong are the ones that say what a tool is without saying when to reach
// for it, and the repair is always the same: the description grows louder
// until it is shouting IMPORTANT at the model. A shape with a place for "use
// when" and a place for "do not" is what makes that unnecessary.
