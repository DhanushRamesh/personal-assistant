// Package failure turns what went wrong into what to say about it.
//
// Two audiences want different things from the same failure. Somebody waiting
// for an answer wants one sentence telling them whether to try again; whoever
// is fixing it wants the exact words the service used, status code and all.
// Writing one line for both produces a sentence that is either useless aloud
// or leaks internals into a room.
//
// So a failure carries both: a [Code], which chooses a fixed sentence, and a
// detail, which is whatever the service actually said. The sentence is spoken
// and shown; the detail waits behind "more info" until asked for.
