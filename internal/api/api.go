// Package api : Assembles the server's HTTP interface from its modules.
//
// Nothing is served from here. Each group of endpoints lives in its own
// package below this one — authn, clients, conversations, chats, assist, health —
// holding its own handlers and wire types, and this package's only job is to build
// them from one set of dependencies, decide the middleware they sit behind,
// and mount them on one router.
//
// Keeping the assembly in one place is what makes the shape of the API
// readable: routes() below is the whole surface, and a module cannot quietly
// register an endpoint somewhere else.
