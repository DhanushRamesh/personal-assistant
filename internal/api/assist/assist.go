// Package assist : Lets Home Assistant use the server as its conversation agent.
//
// Home Assistant reaches a language model through one of its integrations,
// and of those built into it only Ollama's asks for the address of the server
// to call. The server therefore answers in Ollama's shape — a model listing at
// /api/tags and a conversation at /api/chat — because that is the vocabulary
// Home Assistant already speaks. Nothing here runs a model.
//
//	satellite -> Home Assistant -> POST /api/chat   -> a the server chat
//	                            <- newline-delimited JSON, as the answer forms
//
// The answer is streamed for the same reason the server's own clients are given a
// stream: Home Assistant holds the connection open while a chat runs, so a
// chat that takes two minutes survives as long as it keeps saying something,
// and each thing it says can be spoken as it arrives rather than after.
