// Answering: nearest is not relevant. A question with nothing stored about
// it still has a nearest memory, scoring in the same range as a real match,
// so the model is told that none of them fitting is the usual case. It is
// also told to judge the thing rather than the wording: asked what the
// builder charged upstairs, it once refused a note about the roofer and the
// terrace and said nothing was on record, which is both a miss and a false
// statement.
//
// Warning: an assistant that only answers is an instrument. A note that
// contradicts what someone is about to do is worth a line even though it is
// not what they asked, which is exactly the case the answering rule
// forbids. The licence is therefore separate and narrow: only against a
// stated intention, only when the note disagrees with it, one line, and
// attributed.
//
// Empty when there is nothing to offer.
