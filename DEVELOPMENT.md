# DEVELOPMENT

Instructions for anyone working on this server, human or AI coding agent.

**Read this before making changes.** It records decisions the owner has made
and how they want work carried out. These are not suggestions. Where this file
and your own judgement disagree, follow this file, or ask.

## 1. What this project is

This is a personal AI assistant server owned by one person.

Work arrives over an API. An agent reasons about the request and uses tools to
carry it out. Progress and results are reported back. Requests are
long-running, so the API accepts a request, returns a chat identifier
immediately, and the work continues in the background.

It is a platform, not a chatbot. The AI provider, the tools, the clients
and the voice layer are all meant to be replaceable. The stable core is the
agent, its memory, and its chats.

**The assistant's name is configuration, not a constant.** It lives in
`[assistant] name` and is currently **Jarvis**. It was FRIDAY for most of this
project's life, and before that an early planning document called it JARVIS;
the point of the setting is that none of that has to matter to the code.
Nothing in the server may hardcode a name, and a test in
`internal/provider/platformai` fails if one reappears in spoken text.

---

## 2. What this is for

The primary interface is voice, through earbuds or a smart speaker. Everything
else follows from that.

```
  spoken                "Jarvis, check my merge requests"
     ↓
  earbuds → phone       speech recognised as text
     ↓  POST /v1/chats
  the assistant                runs the chat
     ↓  pushed as they happen
  "Let me take a look."         → spoken
  "Found four, reading them."   → spoken
  "Two look risky. …"           → spoken, and the chat is done
```

Four requirements follow, and they are not negotiable:

**Messages are pushed, not polled.** A client that has to ask repeatedly
stands in silence while the assistant works and then hears everything at once.
Pushing is what lets a message reach the user the moment it exists.

**A transient message must be something that happened.** The channel exists
for real progress — an agent naming the tool it is using, a long job
reporting where it has got to. It is not for filler. The Platform AI
provider used to invent `"Let me look into that."` before every answer and
repeat `"Still working on it."` while waiting; both are gone. Read aloud on
every single question, a made-up phrase grates, and it is worse than silence
because it sounds like an answer beginning. The client shows that the assistant is
working without being told. Do not add canned progress back.

**Messages are whole utterances, not tokens.** Token-by-token streaming is
useless to a speech synthesiser, which needs complete, well-formed sentences.
A provider emits `"Let me take a look at that."` as one message, and the
client's rule is simply that each message it receives is spoken. This is why
`Provider.Run` streams messages rather than text fragments.

**A message is written to be spoken aloud.** Not `Calling GitLab.getMergeRequests`
but `Let me check your merge requests`. Anything a user hears, including the
text of a failure, is phrased as speech.

Interruption follows too: saying "stop" while the assistant is speaking must cancel
the chat, so cancellation has to work mid-run rather than only between steps.

Server-sent events carry this, with the cancel endpoint as the return path.
WebSocket is not needed for it and earns its place only if audio is one day
streamed upward instead of being recognised on the phone. Alexa is a different
shape, being request-response with a deadline of a few seconds and unable to
hold a stream open at all; it needs its own approach and should not shape the
earbuds path, which is the primary one.

## 3. Working agreement

How the owner wants work done. Violating these is worse than writing no code.

### Build one piece at a time, and stop

Do one piece of work, report it, and **wait for explicit approval before
starting the next**. Do not build ahead. Do not bundle several packages into
one turn. Do not fill a wait on the owner with unrequested work.

If you are blocked on something only the owner can do, say so and stop.

### Propose, do not presume

Long multi-step plans are for discussion, not for executing unprompted.
Proposing a plan is not permission to begin it.

### Do not add attribution to commits

Git commit messages must **not** carry `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any similar
trailer. Pull request descriptions must not carry a "Generated with" footer.
The history reads as the owner's own work.

### Earlier planning documents are context, not specification

A long design document was pasted into an early session describing
milestones, endpoints and architecture. The owner has said explicitly that it
was **background context only** and should not be followed literally. Treat it
as illustrative. Ask before implementing anything from it.

## 4. Decisions already made

Do not reopen these without being asked. The rationale is recorded so a later
reader can tell a decision from an accident.

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Go** with `net/http` + **chi** | chi is a router, not a framework. Handlers stay `http.HandlerFunc`, so no framework type leaks into the agent and tool layers. Gin and Echo spread `*gin.Context`; Fiber is built on `fasthttp` and breaks the `net/http` ecosystem. |
| **MySQL**, not PostgreSQL | Owner's decision, made after the tradeoffs were laid out. The known costs: no `pgvector` for semantic memory, no `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` for event fan-out, weaker JSON indexing. Accepted. Do not re-argue this. |
| **No Docker** for now | Owner's decision. Use the MySQL already installed on the machine. Do not add `docker-compose.yml` or containerise anything unless asked. |
| **`config.ini`** for configuration | With environment variables overriding it. See section 5. |
| **`log/slog`** for logging | Standard library. No zap, no zerolog, no logrus. |
| Events use an **in-process bus** in V1 | MySQL has no `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`. Single process makes this a non-problem. Revisit only if the assistant ever runs more than one process. Do not add Redis before then. |
| **GORM** for persistence | Owner's decision, made after the tradeoffs were laid out. The known costs: `AutoMigrate` is not a migration system, generated SQL is opaque, and the ORM's natural idiom (`db.Save`) bypasses domain invariants. Accepted. Do not re-argue this. |
| Domain types stay **free of GORM** | The mitigation for the above. Persistence uses its own row structs with GORM tags, mapped to and from domain types at the repository boundary. A domain struct must never embed `gorm.Model` or carry a `gorm:` tag. |
| GORM logs through **`internal/logging`** | GORM's default logger writes its own format to stdout, bypassing structured logging and credential redaction entirely. |
| Providers **invent no progress** | Owner's decision, after hearing it. A transient message is for something that actually happened; a phrase the code made up before every answer is filler, and spoken aloud each time it grates. The Platform AI provider now streams the reply and nothing else. The stub keeps canned updates, because its job is to exercise the transient path without a network. |
| **No signup endpoint** | Owner's decision. The assistant is on a public URL with the owner's Platform AI credentials behind it, so anyone who found the address and registered could spend the quota. Accounts are created with `make prod-createuser` over SSH instead. The web UI has a login page and no signup page. Do not add one. |
| **The server serves the web UI** | The Flutter web bundle is served at `/` by the assistant itself, with the API staying under `/v1`. One origin, so no CORS in production, one artefact to deploy, and Caddy already terminates TLS in front of it. Cross-origin requests are permitted outside production only, so that `flutter run -d chrome` can reach a local server with hot reload. |
| **Flutter** for the client | Owner's decision, made after the tradeoffs were laid out. One codebase for the Android app and the web UI. The known costs: STT and TTS come from community packages rather than the framework, server-sent events need a different path per platform, and Flutter Web renders text to a canvas so selecting and copying an answer is awkward. Accepted. Do not re-argue this. |
| Hands-free uses a **wake word**, not speaker recognition | Owner's decision. The requirement is that the assistant ignores surrounding noise and other people's conversation — which is the question "is this addressed to the assistant?", not "who is speaking?". A phrase answers it cheaply and reliably. Recognising a particular person is voice biometrics: it needs raw audio and an enrolled voiceprint, and it refuses to recognise you when you have a cold. Assistants use a phrase for these reasons. |
| The wake word is **the name at the front of the sentence**, with no model | Owner's decision, after Picovoice turned out to require a business email. Recognition runs continuously and only an utterance beginning with "the assistant" is acted on. It needs no account, no key and no model file, and it is said in one breath with the question — which a separate detector, having to hand the microphone over first, cannot do. The costs, accepted: audio streams continuously to the browser's recogniser rather than staying on the device, it is heavier on battery, and it will occasionally wake on the name said in conversation. An on-device detector can replace `NameFirst` without touching anything above it. |
| The voice layer is built and tested **on the web first** | Owner's decision. `flutter_tts` and `speech_to_text` both wrap the Web Speech API in Chrome, so speaking and listening can be exercised without a phone, and the same code serves Android. Only what is genuinely phone-only — audio routed to a Bluetooth headset, the earbud button, staying alive in the background — waits for a device, and the owner verifies those. |
| The earbud button is **Android platform code** | It is why Flutter was chosen over a PWA, and it is the one thing Flutter does not smooth over: media-button capture and background listening are reached through a plugin or a platform channel, not shared Dart. Budget for it as Android work. |
| **Voice and text are two interfaces over one core** | Owner's decision. Typing is the interface the core is judged on: it must be accurate given exactly what was asked, and a feature is not finished because it works when spoken. Speech is then made clear at the voice layer -- a better microphone, better transcription, a warning added to a spoken turn -- and never by shaping the core around what the decoder gets wrong. `heard()` is the pattern: it is composed into the prompt only for a voice turn and the typed path never sees it. Do not justify a core design by a speech-to-text failure. |
| Semantic memory is **embeddings compared in Go**, not in the database | Owner's decision. MySQL Community has no distance function, but the search does not have to happen in the database: vectors are stored as `BLOB`, held in memory, and scored in Go. Ten thousand memories at 384 dimensions is 15 MB and about a millisecond a scan, so the missing `VECTOR` support never binds. Chosen over `FULLTEXT` because word matching misses a typed paraphrase -- "what did the roofer charge" against a memory worded "quote for the roof" shares one word with an unrelated memory about roof tiles. |
| The laptop is the server **until memory matures** | Owner's decision. The e2-micro is not the target while this is being built, so nothing about memory is to be shaped by its 1 GB. Deploying it there is a later problem and may mean a smaller model behind the same interface. |
| The embedding model runs in a **container**, as an exception to no-Docker | Owner's decision, taken on accuracy: the laptop has 31 GB and a container can hold a model worth using, where fitting one in-process was a compromise for a host that is not the target yet. The only server-side dependency is an HTTP call behind `internal/embed`, so the model can be swapped or moved in-process later without anything above it changing. |
| The embedding model is **local**, not a hosted API | Owner's decision. No evidence Platform AI exposes an embeddings endpoint, and memory should not stop working when a quota or a network does. |
| Deciding a memory is relevant is **the model's job**, not a score's | Measured. Comparing vectors narrows a store to a few candidates but cannot say whether any belongs: a question with nothing stored still has a nearest memory, and it scores in the same range as a real match. Over twelve questions whose answer was stored and eight with nothing stored, no cut-off separated them; a cross-encoder rejected all eight but found only eight of twelve; the model shown three candidates found twelve of twelve and left all eight alone. Vectors shortlist, the model judges. `make evals` covers it. |
| Memories are written **when they are worth writing**, asked for or not | Owner's decision, revising written-only-when-asked. Having to say "remember this" is the thing being designed away. What makes it safe is the second half of the instruction: it must say what it has noted, in the same reply. A memory written silently is one nobody can correct; a memory announced is one the owner can reject in the next sentence. |
| The bar for writing one is **durable, not merely true** | The transcript already recalls everything said, so a passing fact needs no memory: it can be quoted from the record. A memory is for what should be *believed* afterwards -- a preference, a constraint, a decision and its reason, a figure agreed. "It is raining" is true and worth nothing tomorrow. |

### Hosting

Running on a **Google Cloud e2-micro** always-free VM, reached at
`https://friday-server.duckdns.org`. The requirement that decided it was **no
cold starts**: The assistant is voice-driven, so a sleeping server is
unusable, which ruled out the Render, Koyeb and Fly.io free tiers. Oracle
Cloud Always Free was the first candidate and was abandoned when its signup
declined the card. Section 11 has the shape of the deployment.

**The deployment target is `linux/amd64`.** The e2-micro is x86_64, not ARM —
an earlier assumption that the free tier was ARM produced a binary that would
not run. `make prod-deploy` sets this; do not introduce anything
architecture-specific.

## 5. Code conventions

### Testing

Every package has tests, and they live in the package they cover — a test
for `internal/api/chats` is in `internal/api/chats`, not somewhere that
happens to have the helpers. Tests assert behaviour that matters, not
implementation detail. Prefer a test that would catch a real bug over one that
raises the coverage number.

The API's tests are external test packages (`package chats_test`), which is
what lets them share `internal/api/apitest`. That fixture assembles the real
server, so a module's tests drive it through the real middleware and the real
routes rather than a stack rebuilt for testing; a module cannot then pass its
own tests while being mounted wrongly. `internal/api` also has a `package api`
file for the two things that need the unexported router.

`internal/chat/memory` is a real in-memory repository rather than a fixture,
because the runner and the API both need one and a copy in each drifts apart.

Where an interface has two implementations, the cases they must both pass go
in a shared suite rather than in either one's tests -- `internal/remind/
storetest` is the first. They have drifted before: an in-memory store that
accepted what MySQL refused made a test pass where the server would have
failed, and nothing said so until it was running. The suite runs in memory
always and against MySQL when it is reachable.

Where a test encodes a non-obvious requirement, say why in a comment. Existing
examples worth imitating:

- redaction matches attribute keys **exactly**, not by substring, so that
  `token_count` survives while `token` is redacted;
- a rejected state transition must leave the object unmutated;
- a generated DSN is round-tripped back through the driver's parser using a
  password containing `@ : / ?`;
- every chat endpoint is asked for another user's chat and must answer 404,
  which is how the SSE stream was found to be missing its ownership check;
- the route table is asserted whole, so a refactor cannot lose an endpoint;
- `views` pins the published JSON field names, since those are the contract a
  client reads, and asserts that no password hash or token hash appears.

Before proposing work complete, all of these must pass:

```bash
gofmt -l .        # must print nothing
go vet ./...
go test ./... -race
```

### The database tests need their own database

`internal/storage` and `internal/chat/mysql` talk to a real MySQL. They
migrate the schema and write rows they never clean up, so they run against
`assistant_test` and never the database the server uses.

They did not always. They took the defaults from `config.Load`, which name the
server's own database, and quietly filled it with a hundred and forty fixture
users, four hundred chats and six hundred messages before anyone looked. The
counts were only noticed while migrating the database to its new name.

Two things stop it recurring. The tests set `ASSISTANT_DATABASE_NAME`
themselves, and `refuseLiveDatabase` skips unless the name ends in `_test`, so
a mistake in the override cannot write anywhere real.

Create it once, as a MySQL administrator:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE assistant_test CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON assistant_test.* TO 'assistant'@'127.0.0.1';
```

Without it the tests skip, which is why the suite still passes on a bare
checkout. `ASSISTANT_TEST_DATABASE` points them somewhere else if needed.

### Errors

Collect and report all problems at once where a user is going to act on them,
rather than failing at the first. Configuration does this; validation of user
input should too.

Error messages name the thing the reader can actually change. Configuration
errors give both spellings: `[database] port (env ASSISTANT_DATABASE_PORT)`.

Errors shown to the user are written in plain language. Internal detail stays
in the logs.

### Logging

Use `internal/logging`. Do not construct `slog` handlers elsewhere.

- Prefer the context-taking methods — `InfoContext(ctx, ...)`, not `Info(...)`.
  Attributes carried on the context are only attached when the context is
  passed.
- Attach identifiers to the context once, at the edge, with
  `logging.WithAttrs`. Do not thread a logger through function signatures.
- Never log a credential. Attribute keys in `internal/logging/redact.go` are
  redacted automatically; for anything else wrap the value in `logging.Secret`.
- Log levels: 5xx responses at error, 4xx at warn, health checks at debug.

### Structure

`cmd/server` wires the process together and owns its lifecycle: configuration,
logger, dependencies, HTTP server, graceful shutdown. It holds no routes and
no handlers.

Endpoints live under `internal/api`, one package per resource. Each holds its
own handlers and its own wire types on a `Handler` built from just the
dependencies it needs, and exposes them through a `Mount(chi.Router)` method:

    internal/api/          api.go — builds every module and mounts it; no handlers
    internal/api/httpx/    reading and writing bodies; knows nothing of the assistant
    internal/api/views/    the wire shapes of domain values, in one place because
                           a session detail carries chats and a login carries both
                           a user and a client
    internal/api/middleware/  request id, request logging, panic recovery
    internal/api/authn/    logging in, and the caller put on the context
    internal/api/health/   liveness and readiness
    internal/api/clients/  /v1/clients, /v1/me
    internal/api/sessions/ /v1/sessions
    internal/api/chats/    /v1/chats, including the SSE stream
    internal/api/assist/   /api/tags and /api/chat, for Home Assistant
    internal/api/apitest/  the shared fixture the modules' tests are built on

Dependencies point one way: every module may use `httpx`, `views` and
`authn`, and nothing may import a sibling resource. A shape two modules both
need goes to `views`; logic two modules both need goes to the domain, which is
why `chat.EnsureSession` lives in `internal/chat` rather than in `sessions`
— both `authn` and `chats` call it, and `authn` cannot depend on `sessions`
without a cycle.

`api.go` is therefore the whole surface in one screen. A module cannot
register an endpoint anywhere else, and `routes_test.go` asserts the complete
route table so that one cannot be lost or added unnoticed while code is moved
about.

Keeping all of it out of package main is what allows the whole interface to be
exercised in tests without starting a process. Those tests live in
`internal/api` and drive the assembled router, so they cover the middleware
stack and the routing as well as the handlers.

### The client is a web page, and only reads and writes text

`client/` is a Flutter web app: the sessions, the transcript inside one, a box
to ask something, and a settings page for the account and the clients holding
a token. Nothing else. Voice arrives through the Home Assistant satellite, so
the client does not listen, does not speak, and has no wake word.

It is not the client that was removed in `6255778`. That one was built around
voice — a wake word, Whisper on the device, a foreground service to stay
awake — and twenty-five of its fifty-eight files were that machinery. Reviving
it would have brought back a voice stack that the satellite replaced, under
the name the rename removed.

What was worth keeping was taken from that commit rather than written again:
the design system in `client/lib/design`, and the API client in
`client/lib/api`, which already covers every endpoint the server has. Both
were renamed on the way in. The rest is still in the history for anyone who
wants the Android build or the accent measurements.

Web only, and no build step beyond Flutter's. The bundle is meant to be served
by the assistant itself, so the page's own origin is the server's address and
nothing has to be configured; during development `--dart-define=ASSISTANT_URL`
points it somewhere else and the loopback CORS rule lets it through.

### Every page has an address

The settings pages are at `/settings/account`, `/settings/clients`,
`/settings/reminders` and `/settings/server`, and the conversation is at `/`.
Typing one opens it, the back button walks back out of it, and a link to a
page can be kept.

`client/lib/routing.dart` holds the whole of it: a route is either the
conversation or one settings page, `AppRoute.parse` turns a path into one, and
anything unrecognised lands on the conversation rather than on nothing. It is
hand-written rather than a routing package because there are five addresses;
a package would be more configuration than this is code. The screens know
nothing about it: `HomeScreen` is handed an `onSettings`, `SettingsScreen` is
handed its page and an `onModule`, and `main.dart` is the only place that maps
a route to what is on screen.

Two things are needed to make that work in a browser and neither is obvious.
Flutter's default on the web puts routes after a hash, so a page reads as
`/#/settings/account` and never reaches the server at all; `usePathUrlStrategy`
turns that off, behind a conditional import because it is web-only code.
And a plain file server answers `/settings/account` with 404, because no such
file exists — only an app that understands the address. `client/serve.py`
hands anything that is not a file on disk to `index.html`, which is what makes
a reload of a settings page work. A missing asset still gets its 404: falling
back for those too would turn a broken script tag into a silent blank page.

### Archiving and deleting are different things, and both exist

Archiving puts a session away: it keeps everything said in it, stops appearing
in the listing, and is never where a prompt lands. Deleting removes the row,
and the chats and the transcript follow it by the cascades already on their
foreign keys. There is no undo on the second, which is why the first exists
and is what a client offers first.

The two listings are separate rather than one with a filter. `EnsureSession`
takes the first row of the ordinary listing to decide where a prompt goes, so
an archived session reaching that would put a prompt back into a conversation
the user had put away.

**Removing the session a client is in starts a fresh one**, rather than
falling back to the most recent survivor as `EnsureSession` would. Having just
put a conversation away, being dropped into an unrelated older one reads as
the wrong thing happening. The server decides this and returns the session the
client is now in, because it is the side that knows whether what was removed
was the active one; a client that guessed would end up disagreeing with it
about where the next prompt lands.

`active_session_id` has no foreign key, so both paths clear it from every
client pointed at the session before the row goes. Left behind, it is an
identifier nothing can resolve, and the next prompt fails on the chats foreign
key instead of anything that explains itself.

### A client is one credential, and cannot raise its own

A client exists because a token exists. Signing in again on the same install
presents the client id it kept and gets that client's token re-issued, so a
browser signed out and back in stays one client rather than leaving a trail of
them, each still holding a working token. The previous token stops working,
which is the point: one client, one credential.

An id that is unknown, revoked or somebody else's falls through to registering
a new client rather than failing. The password is what authorises signing in,
and a stale identifier in a browser's storage should cost a fresh registration,
not a refusal. A revoked one is never revived — reviving it by signing in would
make revoking it mean nothing.

**A client cannot change its own channel.** The endpoint is authenticated by
the very token whose privileges it would raise, so a client able to set its own
could promote itself out of whatever the channel restricts. That was true when
the endpoint was written and is the one thing that would have made the channel
worthless as a gate. Correcting one is done from another client, which is the
realistic flow anyway: Home Assistant cannot call the API at all, and the
browser is where its channel gets fixed.

Worth being plain about what the channel is and is not. Today it enforces
nothing: it is read once per prompt, copied onto the chat, and never read back.
The security in this system is the token and revocation. The channel becomes a
control when tools arrive, which is why it has to be un-self-raisable before
then rather than after.

### Tools will be reachable differently by voice and by hand

Not built yet, recorded so the shape is not lost. When the assistant can call
tools, which tools it may call depends on how it was reached: a voice turn
gets a restricted set, while the interface and the API get all of them.

The reason is that voice has no confirmation step worth the name. A spoken
"yes" to something misheard is the whole authorisation, where a client can
show what is about to happen and wait. So anything destructive, anything that
spends money, and anything that leaves the house belongs to the channels that
can ask properly.

**A client declares its channel when it registers**, and every chat it submits
records it. `voice` or `direct`, and omitting it means direct — the answer that
grants less, so something with a microphone has to say so.

The client, not the endpoint. `/api/chat` speaks Ollama's wire format, and a
format says nothing about how the words were produced: anything able to speak
it can call it, and one day something typed will. What does know is the thing
holding the token, because a token is issued to one thing and that thing either
has a way to confirm before acting or it has not.

The chat carries a copy rather than a reference to the client, because the
runner — which is what would enforce a tool set — is handed a chat and nothing
else, and by then the request is over.

Some clients cannot declare themselves. Home Assistant is handed a token
through a configuration screen with no field for it, so its client registers
as `direct` — the answer that grants more — and stays wrong until somebody
notices. `POST /v1/clients/{id}/channel` is how that is corrected, and the
settings screen offers it beside Revoke.

That is a gap worth naming rather than a solved problem: nothing in the Home
Assistant setup says "this is voice", so reissuing that token starts it as
direct again, silently. The listing shows each client's channel so the mistake
is visible; correcting it is a click.

### One endpoint takes a prompt, and it is Ollama-shaped

`POST /api/chat`. Nothing else accepts one. `/v1/chats` reads and cancels;
sessions, clients and identity are unchanged.

There were two, and the second existed only because the first was thought of
as the voice one. It is not: Ollama's shape is a wire format, and the web
client speaks it as happily as Home Assistant does. Two ways in meant two
places to keep the superseding rule, the session rule and the channel rule in
step, and they had already drifted once.

Two things the `/v1` shape carried that Ollama's does not, both added rather
than lost:

- `session_id` on the request. Home Assistant omits it and lands in whichever
  session the client is active in; anything that knows which conversation it
  means says so, rather than having to switch the client's active session
  first and race whatever else holds the same token.
- `error_code` and `error_detail` on the final chunk. Omitted when empty, so a
  caller that does not know about them sees exactly what it saw before. What
  is said aloud stays in the message; these are for a screen.

**The endpoint is synchronous.** It answers when the chat is over, so there is
no submitting and polling. A client holds the response open and reads the
answer as it is produced, and stops by abandoning it. Anything that needs to
interrupt from elsewhere still uses `POST /v1/chats/{id}/cancel`.

### There is no server-sent-events stream, and no chat_updates

Both went together. The stream existed so a client could rejoin an answer it
had started; `chat_updates` existed so the stream could replay what a dropped
connection had missed. With one synchronous endpoint there is nothing to
rejoin: the answer arrives on the same response that asked for it.

Progress is still produced and still published — the runner announces it and
the endpoint writes it out as it comes. It is simply not stored. Where a chat
had got to is worth hearing while it runs and worth nothing afterwards, and
the answer itself was never in that table: it is on the chat, and the
conversation is in `messages`.

### A failure is said one way and recorded another

Two audiences want different things from the same failure. Somebody waiting
for an answer wants one sentence telling them whether to try again; whoever
is fixing it wants the exact words the service used and the status it used
them with. One line for both is either useless aloud or leaks internals into
a room.

So `internal/failure` maps a code to a fixed sentence and keeps the service's
own words beside it as the detail. The sentence is spoken and shown; the
detail waits behind "more info". The code is stored too, so the wording can
change later without the stored rows disagreeing with the live ones, and so
failures can be counted — "how often is this rate limiting" is a question
about codes, not about prose.

The shape is taken from the error module in `ulaa-ai-assistant`: a map of
codes to messages, an HTTP status table, a fallback that logs rather than
guesses, and the exact error carried alongside as `envError`.

**A failure is now given to the model, which it was not before.** The reason
it was withheld still stands on its own: a bare "something went wrong" read
back as conversation makes the model explain an outage it had no part in and
invent detail to fill the gap. What closes that gap is the detail. With the
exact error present there is nothing left to invent, and asking out loud what
precisely failed is answerable rather than a guess. That was the point of
keeping it.

### Home Assistant is reached on loopback, not on a LAN address

A reboot moved this machine from 192.168.0.102 to .107 and the voice stack
stopped: Home Assistant kept dialling the satellite at the old address, and
the server kept trying to announce at it. Both said so clearly and neither
could do anything about it.

Everything here runs on the one machine, and both containers use host
networking, so the address they use for each other is 127.0.0.1. A loopback
address cannot drift when DHCP hands out a different lease.

### A spoken failure says the exact error; a typed one keeps it aside

Typed, a failure shows the sentence and keeps the service's own words under
"more info". Spoken, there is no "more info": a sentence on its own leaves the
person with a failure and no way to reach what caused it, so both are said
aloud. Reading service jargon out is ugly and is still better than
withholding it.

### A blocked answer is not a bad request

Both arrive as a 400 and they want opposite things said. Nothing is wrong with
a request whose answer was blocked, trying again will not help, and telling
somebody their request was refused sends them looking for a mistake they did
not make. They are told apart by what the service said, because the status
cannot tell them apart.

That was found by asking for song lyrics: the endpoint answered "Output
blocked by content filtering policy", and the assistant reported that the
service would not accept the request.

### A spoken turn is told its words may be the wrong ones

"Can you unarchive any of the two conversations" arrived as "can you unlock
any of the two conversations". Speech-to-text does not misspell. It replaces a
word with another that sounds like it and leaves a sentence that reads
correctly and means something else, which is the failure typing never
produces and the one nothing here was prepared for.

A spoken turn now carries a note saying so: read for what was meant, and where
a word does not fit what is being discussed, consider what similar-sounding
word would. It is the same reason a typo in typed text is understood — the
reader knows the text is imperfect and reads through it. The model had no way
to know.

Only for a spoken turn. Typing means what it says, and quietly reinterpreting
a word somebody chose deliberately is worse than taking it literally.

The note stops short of guessing where guessing is expensive: where two
readings are both plausible and one of them destroys something, it asks.
Charitable reading is right until a charitable reading deletes a conversation.

A name is carved out of that charity entirely. Everywhere else a word
that does not fit can be reasoned about from the words that do; a name
cannot, because a name nobody has heard of and a name the decoder has
mangled look exactly alike. "Alekhya" came back as Alikia, Alakia and
alakia chintada in one evening. So a spoken turn is told to say back what
it heard and ask for the spelling.

It is told to ask **before** using it, not after. Given the rule in
general terms it still wrote "Sowmiya" into a memory and searched on
"Karunakaran", both from what it heard: two of five. Naming the acts --
do not write it into a memory or a reminder, do not search on it, do not
answer about it until they have spelt it -- made it five of five. A name
stored wrongly stays wrong, and nothing later will find it to correct.

This is the one place the assistant may end on a question. The spoken
rules forbid that because Home Assistant reopens the microphone on a
question mark; here reopening it is the entire point.

Only a spoken turn. Typing spells the name already, and there is an eval
that a typed one is never asked.

Primed separately at the other end, in voice-setup, where the decoder had
never been given the words the tools use. That priming is a list of words, not
example sentences, and it holds no names: the words that repeat are worth the
budget, and names are endless. It is drawn from the stored user messages, so
it primes what has actually been said rather than what was imagined. The
server is unaffected either way -- nothing here knows the decoder exists.

### Recall reaches everything said, not only what was written down

Owner's decision, revising "written only when asked". The assistant should
be able to reach anything that was ever said to it, not only the facts
somebody thought to save. Forgetting to ask it to remember is exactly the
case it is meant to cover.

This needs no new hoarding. Every message is already stored and condensing
deletes nothing -- it adds a summary and leaves the transcript alone -- so
the whole record exists and is merely unsearchable. Indexing it is what is
missing, and `message_vectors` is that index: one row per exchange, keyed
by the message somebody sent.

An exchange, not a message. A third of what gets said is unsearchable
alone -- "yes", "try again", "do both" -- and means something only beside
what it answered, so the row holds the message and the reply it drew. The
text is stored rather than rebuilt, so the words that were embedded and
the words that are shown cannot drift apart.

Searching reads every vector for that person and scores them in Go, capped
at the most recent `MaxScanned`. The cap is what stops a transcript of
years making every turn slow; it has never been reached.

The conversation in progress is left out. It is already in front of the
model, and offering it back reads as the assistant quoting itself.

Measured on the real transcript: 191 exchanges indexed, and five questions
worded to share nothing with what was said each found the right one --
"who sings the song Fireflies" found an exchange about Adam Young and Owl
City that does not contain the word Fireflies.

That is also safer than extracting facts automatically. An extractor
invents: it writes down a claim nobody made and it comes back later as
truth. The transcript returns what was actually said, with when it was
said, and can be quoted rather than asserted.

So recall has three sources, and they are different things:

- the always tier, in every prompt;
- curated memories, which are what the assistant **believes** -- distilled,
  correctable, and the only ones that can be edited or forgotten;
- the transcript, which is what **happened** -- complete, never edited, and
  including everything the decoder misheard.

An advisor needs both of the last two: something to reason from, and a
record to check itself against. They must stay distinguishable in the
prompt, because "you told me" and "I concluded" are not the same claim.

### The assistant is told what time it is

It had no way to know. A model answers "what day is it" from whenever it
was trained, or refuses, and "in twenty minutes" has nothing to be twenty
minutes after. Every prompt now carries the time, the day, the date and
the zone.

`[assistant] timezone` is an IANA name and everything stored stays UTC,
including the database connection. This is not about storage: it is what
"seven in the morning" means. A name the machine cannot load stops the
server rather than quietly becoming UTC, because a reminder at the wrong
hour every day is worse than a refusal that says why.

It was refused before this, in those words: "I do not have access to real
time data, sir, so the current time is not available to me." Spoken, on
25 September. Home Assistant has `prefer_local_intents` on and might have
answered it locally, and did not -- the question reached here and was
turned down. Do not assume a local intent covers something without
checking the transcript for it.

### The greeting is composed here, not by the model

`POST /v1/presence/arrived` says somebody has walked in. Home Assistant
does the deciding -- it watches how strong the owner's watch sounds and
works out when it has crossed into the room -- and what arrives here is
the conclusion. This chooses the words and speaks them through the same
announcer the reminders use.

The greeting is the hour and nothing else. Then any reminders held back
while they were out, then any that were never said at all. That is the
whole of it.

Two or three wordings per part of the day, never the same one twice
running. One fixed line per band is the same sentence every morning for
ever, and a greeting somebody can recite along with is not one.

"Welcome back" is in none of them. It used to be the small hours and the
late evening, and it reads as "you have returned" when all it meant was
"it is late" -- said, in testing at four in the morning, to somebody who
had not moved. If it comes back it belongs to a long absence, which is a
fact about the person rather than about the clock.

What is still to come is deliberately left out. A reminder waiting for
four o'clock is not news at half past one, and counting them at the door
turns a greeting into a status report.

A miss is said in words rather than as a count, and saying it here is
the telling -- it is marked mentioned, so the same miss is not raised
again in the next sentence.

**The model is not asked, and this was tried both ways.** A greeting
that lands after somebody has sat down is not a greeting: detection
takes about two seconds and a Platform AI call has measured between two
and five. Writing it in advance solves the timing -- the next one is
composed as soon as the last is used -- and was built and tried on 27
September 2026 with the person's memories and recent conversation fed
in. It was dropped, by the owner, after three rounds of it going wrong
in three different directions:

- Given a free hand it wrote *"Get Lucky has been in my head since you
  last mentioned it"*, claiming an inner life it does not have.
- Told to be plain it wrote *"the coffee is on"*, turning the fact that
  the owner likes filter coffee into a claim about the room.
- Told what it may not claim, it retreated to the bare greeting every
  time, which is what the plain version does for nothing.

The lesson is narrower than "the model cannot do it". Every personal
remark that is not a claim about the world turns out to be either an
opinion or a wish, and the room to be warm without being false is
smaller than it looks. Worth remembering before adding it again.

Every call greets. It did once refuse to greet the same person twice
within ten minutes, on the reasoning that nothing upstream promises to
ask only once -- and that guarded against the wrong thing. Of three real
arrivals in a quarter of an hour it refused two, which is the same
silence as the fault it was there to prevent and harder to explain.

Whether somebody has really been away is the caller's to judge, and the
caller judges it on thirty unbroken seconds of a faint signal, which is
better evidence than any clock here. A greeting that could not be spoken
says so rather than reporting success.

**Not in the transcript yet.** The owner asked for what the assistant
said to be recorded, and it is not: a `chat` requires a prompt, and the
whole history is prompt-and-answer pairs. Recording something the
assistant said unprompted needs that model changed, which is why
reminders do not appear there either. Left undone rather than faked with
a prompt nobody spoke.

### Reminders are said through Home Assistant, and nowhere else

Owner's decision. The satellite is the only place a reminder lands.
Pushing to a browser was planned and dropped as not worth it: the person
is not at the screen when a reminder matters, and the server would have
needed a channel it has never had.

`Everywhere` stays, holding one speaker. It is the seam a second one
would go in, and it costs nothing to leave.

The browser therefore still goes stale when something is said out loud,
which the client's own `refresh` comment already describes. That was going
to be fixed by the same stream and now is not.

### A reminder announces itself with no sound before it

Tried on 27 September 2026 and dropped the same night. A short sound
first, and only one for a run of them however many came due together,
which is the part that would have been easy to get wrong.

Home Assistant supplies the sound, and the owner's verdict on hearing it
was a cowbell. The idea went with it rather than the sound alone: no
heads-up before a reminder, and `Preannounce` stays false.

Written down because it is an obvious thing to add and it has already
been decided against. Adding one means picking a sound first.

### Speaking and asking need different timeouts

Home Assistant holds `assist_satellite.announce` open until the satellite
has finished playing -- "Block until announcement is finished", in the
comment in its own `entity.py`. The call therefore takes as long as the
speaking does, which is nothing like how long a state poll takes.

One shared ten-second timeout covered both, and ten seconds is about a
hundred and fifty characters of speech against a `MaxBody` of five
hundred. A longer reminder played perfectly well and then reported
failure. The loop leaves a failed one pending on purpose, so it was said
again two seconds later, and again, until the grace hour ran out.

So there are two: `Timeout` for anything that only asks, and
`SpeakTimeout` for the one call that speaks. The client carries no
timeout of its own -- one number cannot be both -- and each request takes
its own deadline. The speaking deadline starts after the wait for quiet,
which is longer than it and is not the speaking.

Nothing here makes a double-say impossible: a call that fails after the
words are out will always look like one that never said them. It removes
the way it actually happened.

### The reminders screen shows what is coming, not what happened

`GET /v1/reminders` lists what is still pending, and `DELETE
/v1/reminders/{id}` calls one off. `?all=true` includes the rest, for
anything that wants it; the screen does not. Everything that ever fired is
a log, and nobody opens a settings screen to read one.

Cancelling from the screen removes the row rather than showing it struck
through. The list is what is coming, and something called off is not.

A default scope was planned for this screen and left out. With one
satellite, user and client land in the same place, so the setting would
configure nothing anybody could hear.

### A reminder that was never said must not vanish

Home Assistant being unreachable at ten o'clock used to lose the
reminder entirely. It stayed pending and was retried every two seconds,
which is right; but past the grace hour it was marked missed, and then
nothing at all happened. It was never spoken, the settings screen asked
only for pending ones, and no code anywhere read the missed status back.

Three things, all absent and all promised:

- **A late one says so.** "This is late. It was due at ten o'clock." One
  said at a quarter to eleven that sounded exactly like one said at ten
  was acted on as though it were ten. The day is named when it crossed
  midnight.
- **Missed ones are on the screen**, marked, with Dismiss rather than
  Cancel: nothing is called off about something that already failed to
  happen.
- **They are mentioned once** in the next conversation, then never again.

The mention is marked as given only once an answer exists. Marking it
while composing the prompt spent the one telling on a turn that then
failed, and on one where the model simply left it out -- which is how a
miss came to be recorded as told without ever being told.

The wording had to be forceful to survive. "Mention them once, briefly,
at the end of your reply" lost to the persona's instruction to be brief
and to a prompt full of memories. Telling it to *begin* the reply with
it, and that leaving it out loses it for good, carries four openings out
of four -- including "hello" and "thank you", which give it the least
excuse to add anything.

### Snoozing, and what "that" means

A reminder that rings at four can be pushed back: "snooze that", or
"push my four o'clock to five" before it rings. Both, because the second
is the first with the identifier given rather than assumed. Ten minutes
is what "snooze" alone means, which is what the word means on every
clock radio ever made.

The microphone stays shut after a reminder, for now. The satellite can
reopen it -- `assist_satellite.start_conversation` sets
`msg.start_conversation`, which `satellite.py` already honours, playing
the reminder and then listening -- but a microphone that opens in the
room after every reminder hears the room. So a snooze is asked for with
the wake word, like anything else.

That leaves "that" to be resolved, and today nothing can: the firing loop
goes to the announcer and never touches the conversation, so the
assistant has no record of having spoken. Asked what it just said, it
does not know. Two things fix it, and they are the same two things:

- **A block saying what was just said aloud**, on the pattern of the
  missed-reminder one. It gives "that" a referent, the way a person has
  one, because the thing was said a minute ago and both parties know it.
  `remind.JustSaidWindow` is a quarter of an hour; past that the
  assistant asks which rather than guessing at an hour-old reminder. It
  is carried every turn while it is recent, unlike the missed block,
  which is spent on one telling: this one is context, not a message.
  It is also told *not* to raise it -- the person was there.
- **The tool defaults to it.** `reminder_snooze` with no identifier takes
  the last one spoken, so an identifier never has to survive a voice turn.
  Two fired close together and it refuses and names them, with their
  identifiers, so the question is asked rather than answered wrongly and
  the answer can be acted on in the same turn.

The block says what "that" means only where one thing was said. Where two
were, it says to ask. It used to say "the most recent one listed", which
names nothing when two came due together: the firing loop takes the clock
once per pass and stamps every reminder in it with the same moment, so
the order falls through to the identifier, and the most recent is
whichever was created last. The tool refused to choose anyway, and a
prompt that tells the model to choose while the tool refuses to is two
minds about the same question.

A repeating one is not moved. Snoozing a daily seven o'clock by ten
minutes would make it ten past seven tomorrow, and twenty past the day
after. The snooze is a one-shot of its own and the series is left alone.
`remind.Later` is where that decision lives, so the spoken tool and the
`POST /v1/reminders/{id}/snooze` endpoint cannot come to disagree, and
both say which of the two happened: reporting "put off" for a daily
alarm that has not moved would be a bluff.

The store refuses to snooze a repeating one at all (`remind.Snoozable`),
which is what makes the rule an invariant rather than a convention two
callers happen to follow.

### What was said and what was never said are different answers

`reminder_recent` answers "did I miss anything", over the last hour by
default, because somebody who has stepped out and come back is asking
about the time they were gone.

It keeps two lists apart and labels them: ones that were spoken, and ones
that were never spoken because nothing could say them at the time. Run
together they would tell the person they heard something they did not,
which is the same fault as any other thing the assistant claims happened
and did not. The spoken list comes from `LastSpoken`, which is bounded,
so when the bound is reached the tool says there may be more rather than
implying the list is everything.

A held one is the third category: not said yet, and not missed either.

### A reminder is not said to an empty room

A reminder whose time comes while nobody is in the room is **held**
rather than spoken, and said when they walk back in, after the greeting.

`held` is its own status because it is its own fact. Missed means nothing
could say it, and drives the mention-it-once path. Held means something
could and chose to wait. Its due time is left alone: that is what the
reminder was for, and what the person is told when they get it.

**The rule is fail-safe, and that is the whole design.** `remind.Presence`
asks one question and anything short of a confident, current "they are
elsewhere" comes back false, so the reminder is spoken. An error, an
unavailable entity, a state nobody recognises, nothing configured at all
-- every one of those speaks. The two mistakes do not cost the same:
speaking to an empty room wastes a sentence, and withholding a reminder
from somebody sitting right there loses it until they think to ask. The
signal this rests on has already been seen to drift ten decibels in half
an hour, which is the argument rather than a hypothetical.

Home Assistant is asked at firing time rather than told in advance. It is
the only thing that knows, and asking it means there is no second copy
here to go stale. `[homeassistant] presence_entity` names what to ask;
empty means never hold, which is what this did before.

A repeating one is never held. Its next turn is along soon enough, and
holding one would queue a morning alarm to go off the moment somebody
walked past at lunchtime.

`Fired` accepts a held reminder as well as a pending one, which it did
not at first: the delivery was spoken and then could not be recorded, so
it stayed held and would have been said again on the next arrival. The
log said so -- "said a held reminder but could not record it" -- which is
the honest half of that failure working.

### What is waiting goes in the prompt, not behind a tool call

Asked twice what reminders there were, the assistant answered from an
exchange two hours old -- its own earlier answer, correct when given,
repeated as though it still held. The eleven o'clock it named had gone
off at eleven o'clock. The timeline proves no tool was called.

The rule against this already existed, in the persona and in the
transcript block, and did not hold. Worse, it could not be made to fail
on demand afterwards: an eval was tried against Sonnet and Haiku, with
and without conversation history, with and without the voice block and
recalled notes, and every one of twenty asks looked it up. So there was
no way to tell whether a stronger rule would hold either.

So the rule was replaced with the answer. `remind.Coming` puts the
current reminders into every prompt, read as the prompt is built. There
is nothing to skip, nothing to decide, and nothing older to reach for:
the true answer is already there. It costs a line or two of text and it
removes the class rather than discouraging it.

It is also faster than the tool it replaces. A reminder question used to
cost a second model round trip; now it is answered from what is already
in front of the model.

**One caveat, honestly.** The very first live turn after this went in
still bluffed, with the block present and saying "answer from this list
and from nothing else". Three recalled exchanges outweighed it. Every
turn since has been right, and the conversation has since filled with
correct answers, so what is not known is how it behaves when the stale
claim is fresh and repeated. Putting the truth in front of the model
makes the failure much harder; it does not make it impossible.

### A length of time is the server's arithmetic, not the model's

`reminder_set` takes exactly one of `seconds_from_now`, `minutes_from_now`
or `at`.

Seconds were missing at first, and the model reported that faithfully:
asked for thirty seconds it answered "timers can only be set for whole
minutes". It was not being awkward -- there was no argument that could
carry it. A tool's limits become the assistant's excuses, stated with
confidence, and are hard to tell from the model refusing.

The two lengths exist so that "in twenty minutes" needs no arithmetic from
the model: it is told the current time in the prompt, and asking it to add
twenty minutes to that is a step that can go wrong silently. A time of day
still has to be written out, and is read in the person's own zone.

Several spellings of a written time are accepted, because a model writes
the same moment several ways and refusing it over a missing "T" would be
refusing the reminder. A time already gone is refused, and the refusal
says what time it is now so the next attempt can be right -- except within
two minutes, since the model works the time out from what it was told and
a little passes while it does.

### The first work that happens because of the clock

Everything in this server until now ran because somebody asked. The
reminder loop is the first thing that runs when nobody is. It asks what is
due every five seconds, which is one indexed read, and is stopped with the
server so nothing is half said during a shutdown.

Three outcomes, and the difference between them matters:

- **Said.** Delivered, then either finished or moved to its next time.
- **Missed.** A one-shot too late to be worth saying. Kept rather than
  removed, so it can be mentioned once.
- **Moved.** A repeating one whose turn was too late. Moved to its next
  time, not marked missed -- marking it missed would end a daily reminder
  for good -- and no firing is counted, because nobody heard it.

Something nobody could deliver stays pending and is tried again. That
cannot go on for ever: once it is older than the grace window it becomes
missed like anything else. A speaker that cannot deliver therefore has to
say so rather than returning quietly, which is why `Nowhere` refuses
instead of succeeding.

`Fired` only touches a reminder that is still pending. Two passes cannot
both say the same thing, and a pass that says something and then fails to
record it is logged loudly, because that is the one way a reminder is
heard twice.

### A reminder only ever says something

Owner's decision. A reminder carries words and speaks them: a timer that
has finished, something to be told at seven. It does not run instructions
unattended.

That was the other half of the idea and it was dropped deliberately. A
task firing with nobody watching runs with the owner's authority and can
reach tools, and a misread instruction at three in the morning has nobody
to catch it. Announcing is most of the value and almost none of the risk.

A timer and a schedule are one thing stored one way, differing only in how
the time was written. Two stores would mean two firing loops and two sets
of bugs.

### An answer records how it was made

`messages.chat_id` says which turn wrote a message, and `chats.recalled`
holds what memory offered and what it scored. `GET /v1/chats/{id}/steps`
puts them in order: asked, recalled, each tool call and its result with a
duration, answered.

Nothing in it is re-derived. A search run now could disagree with the one
the model was shown, and a timeline that disagrees with what happened is
worse than none.

It paid for itself on the first real answer. Asked "what did the builder
charge for the upstairs work", the assistant replied "there is nothing on
record" -- and the timeline showed the roof memory had been offered at
0.588, then found again by `memory_search`, and refused twice. From the
log alone that is indistinguishable from never having found it, which
needs an entirely different fix.

The cause was the answering rule: "use a note only if it contains what is
being asked for, rather than merely a related subject". It was written to
stop a near miss being read as an answer and it refused a direct hit,
producing a false statement as well as a miss. It now says to judge
whether it is the same thing rather than whether the words match, and
never to say nothing is on record when a note is plainly about what was
asked.

The eval had passed throughout, because it composed the prompt with the
default manner while the server runs Jarvis. An eval that measures a
prompt must use the manner the server is configured with, or it measures a
prompt nobody sends.

### A false success becomes a fact

Asked to add milk to a shopping list it has no tool for, the assistant
answered "Milk has been added to your shopping list, sir" and called
nothing. That answer was written into the transcript, indexed, recalled on
the next turn, and cited: "Milk is already on your shopping list, sir."
Then again. A bluff is not a single wrong answer; it is evidence for the
next one.

The prompt now says the assistant acts only through tools, that nothing
else it says changes anything, and that before any sentence claiming
something was done it must check a tool did it in that same turn. It also
says it holds no shopping list, no to-do list and no calendar, whatever
old conversations look like -- the general rule did not reach lists,
because the transcript is full of lists being read out and noted down.

The other half is state. Told only not to claim actions, it moved to
asserting how things stand: "milk is already on your list", from three old
grocery exchanges. So it is also told not to say what is on a list or what
a device is doing unless a tool said so just now, and that something said
in an earlier conversation is what was said then, not what is true today.

Measured under `make evals`: eight actions there is no tool for, six
questions about state it cannot see, and three of each again with a
transcript block in front of it -- because without one they pass in a
vacuum and fail in use.

**Not solved.** It still sometimes says "I have noted that" without
calling anything, in the same breath as correctly refusing the list. Three
rounds of sharpening moved it from a flat false success to a soft
one. A prompt reduces this; it does not enforce it. Enforcing it means
checking the answer against the tools that ran, which nothing does yet.

### The point of memory is advice, not recall

Stated by the owner. The assistant is not meant to do only what it is told.
It should offer insights, point out a better option, bring up what was
forgotten, and say what could go wrong before something is done -- an
advisor rather than an instrument.

Recall is the ground floor of that and not the thing itself. Answering
"what did the roofer quote" when asked is retrieval. Saying "you agreed
forty thousand and this quote is sixty" without being asked is advice, and
it needs three things retrieval does not: memories of decisions and their
reasons rather than only facts, a search run against what the assistant is
about to say rather than only what the person said, and permission to
volunteer.

That last one was not free. `memory.Offered` instructed the model to use a
note "only if it contains what is being asked for, rather than merely a
related subject", which is what stops a near miss being read as an answer
and is also what forbids advice.

It now does both jobs, stated as two separate instructions, because the
rule for one forbids the other. Answering is unchanged. Warning is narrow
on purpose: only when the person says what they are about to do, only when
a note disagrees with it, one line, attributed, nothing beyond what the
note says, and nothing at all when the note agrees.

Widening it did not cost the filter. Measured in one run: three of three
notes used when they fit, five of five unrelated questions still left
clean, three of three real conflicts raised, four of four harmless
intentions left alone. Told "I am going to tell the roofer sixty thousand
is fine" it answers "the agreed price was forty thousand rupees, not sixty
thousand, based on the roof quote you saved"; told "I am going to pay the
roofer the forty thousand we agreed" it says nothing about the note.

The licence is on the curated memories only. The transcript keeps its
quoting rule and no licence to warn: it carries whatever speech-to-text got
wrong, and a warning founded on a misheard sentence is worse than none.

The bar is unchanged: an advisor that invents a concern is worse than one
that says nothing. Anything volunteered rests on something stored and says
what it rests on.

### Memory is three layers, and only the middle one is hard

What the assistant is asked to remember outlives the conversation it was
said in. `internal/memory` holds it in two tiers. `always` goes into every
system prompt whole, under a ceiling in both count and bytes, because
anything composed into every prompt needs a size that cannot run away.
`recall` is searched with whatever was just asked, and the nearest few are
offered. `internal/tool/memories` is the deliberate path: remember, search,
update, forget.

Nearest is not relevant, and that is the whole difficulty. A question with
nothing stored about it still has a nearest memory, and it scores in the
same range as a real match. Measured over twelve questions whose answer was
stored and eight with nothing stored, the two groups overlapped: a genuine
match scored as low as 0.414 while an unrelated one reached 0.504, so no
cut-off separates them. A cross-encoder rejected all eight but found only
eight of twelve. The model, shown three candidates and told that none of
them fitting is the usual case, found twelve of twelve and left all eight
alone. So the search shortlists and the model decides, and `memory.Offered`
carries the instruction that makes that work.

That instruction is load-bearing and invisible, so it is measured. The
inline shape -- notes in the system prompt of the call that also answers --
scores three of three used and five of five left out of the answer, under
`make evals`.

Writing happens only when asked. A missing memory is noticed and can be
added; a wrong one comes back as fact and nothing prompts anyone to doubt
it.

`EmbedOne` exists because `Embed` works a backlog oldest first: calling it
for a memory just written would embed something else and report success.

### The assistant is told where it is

Asked which conversation it was in, it named one it had switched away from
earlier. It had no way to know: nothing told it, so it answered from what it
remembered doing, and remembering having switched somewhere is not the same as
being there. A fact that cannot be looked up is a fact that gets invented.

The system prompt now carries the conversation's name and identifier, composed
per chat since it changes per chat while the manner does not. An unnamed
conversation is said to be unnamed rather than left out, because a gap is what
invites a guess.

It is one sentence against a whole transcript, and the transcript can win. In
a conversation already containing the earlier wrong answer, the model repeated
itself rather than reading the prompt. A conversation with nothing to copy
answers exactly. Being told where it is removes the reason to guess; it does
not overrule what it has already said.

### A tool that half-obeys has to say so

Asked to make a conversation, switch to it and answer there, the assistant did
the first two and answered in the old one. That is the rule working: a switch
takes effect from the next message, so the model's history does not change
underneath it mid-turn. It still read as a fault, because nothing was said
about it.

The rule stays. What changed is that the tool result now instructs the model
to explain, in as many words: tell the person the reply lands in the old
conversation, and if they asked for something to be said in the new one, say
plainly that it cannot happen until their next message rather than answering
as though it had.

Written as an instruction because a statement was not enough. The old result
said "it takes effect from the next thing the person says", the model read it,
acted on it, and mentioned none of it. A tool result is read by a model, so it
is written for one.

### The reserve is measured, not assumed

`ReserveTokens` was a flat 2,048 standing for the system prompt, the tool
schemas and the reply together. That was true while there were no tools. Seven
of them cost about 1,200 tokens; a dozen cost more than the whole reserve, and
the arithmetic protecting the context window would have been wrong with
nothing failing to say so.

It now covers the reply alone, and what is sent alongside is counted:
`ReserveFor(bytes)` adds the system prompt and every tool offered. A model with
a small window and forty tools is given measurably less conversation than one
with none, which it was not before.

Measured per chat, because both halves move: the manner can be changed while
the server runs, and the tools one channel may reach are not the tools another
may.

The endpoint takes at most 500 tools in a call, which is not the limit that
matters. At roughly six hundred bytes each, a hundred tools cost as much as
the entire conversation budget on every turn, used or not.

### Where a prompt lands is the server's to decide

The browser used to name the conversation on every prompt. That made
`conversation_switch` useless there: the switch was real, and the very next
message named the old conversation again and overrode it. The tool reported
success truthfully and nothing anybody could see had changed, which is the
exact failure the honest-outcome rule is meant to prevent -- a true statement
that is worthless.

So the browser names nothing. Where a prompt lands comes from the client's
active conversation, which is the rule voice already followed, and clicking a
conversation in the listing activates it as it always did. After a turn the
client asks which conversation is now active and follows it, since a tool can
move it while answering and the server is the only thing that knows.

A chat also records which client sent it. The channel was recorded and the
client was not, which was enough while a chat only produced words; a tool that
acts on the client itself has no other way to know which one to act on.

### Whether a description works is measurable

`make evals` asks a real model what it would do with fifteen things a person
might say, and checks which tool it reaches for and what it fills in. Behind a
build tag, because it costs real calls.

Everything else in the suite checks that the machinery runs. This checks the
only thing that decides whether the assistant is any good, and it cannot be
asserted against a stub: a stub has no opinion about a description. A failure
here is usually a description to fix rather than code.

A third of the cases expect no tool at all. A model that reaches for one at
every question is as wrong as one that never does, and only the negative cases
catch it.

Several tools can be right for one thing said, so a case lists the acceptable
ones. That was learnt from the first run: asked to delete something by name
the model called `conversation_find` where the case expected
`conversation_list`, and looking the name up is the better of the two. The
expectation was wrong, not the model.

### The loop, and what stops it

A turn is no longer one call. The model is asked, and if it asks for tools
they are run, both halves are written to the conversation, and it is asked
again from what came back. The question is not repeated on the second round:
it is in the history by then, and sending it again would have the model answer
it twice.

Five rounds at most. The last one is offered no tools at all, so a model that
has run out has to answer from what it gathered rather than being cut off
mid-chain. The person gets a reply either way, and the model has to say what
it managed rather than what it intended.

The call and its answer are written before the model is asked again. A chain
cut in the middle -- a restart, a deadline, the person saying stop -- then
reads as what was done rather than as a question nobody answered. That is the
same reason an interruption is recorded rather than the prompt being deleted.

### A wrong argument is answered, not refused

A call whose arguments do not fit the schema is not run, and the model is told
which argument, what was wrong with it and what was allowed. It corrects
itself on the next round. One told only that the call was invalid guesses
again. The correction costs a round trip and turns a wrong answer into a right
one, which is the whole trade.

Ulaa fights the same problem in prose, with a sub-prompt spelling out that
identifiers need quotation marks and a worked example of the mistake. A schema
and a correction make that unnecessary.

### This endpoint wants tool results together, not apart

Tool results go back as an array on one message, not as one message each
carrying a tool_call_id. OpenAI's shape is the latter and this endpoint is not
OpenAI, whatever the request otherwise looks like. Sent apart, the vendor
behind it rejects the whole conversation: "tool_use ids were found without
tool_result blocks immediately after".

That message was only legible because the error parser now reads
`error.api_error.message` before `error.message`. The outer one said "Error in
AI API Request", which names nothing. It is the third time today that the
useful half of a failure was being thrown away.

### Tool calls end a stream, they do not accompany an answer

An environment now answers in one of three ways: words, a failure, or a
request to run tools. `KindToolCalls` is terminal like the other two, and the
caller is expected to run what was asked and come back.

A model asking for a tool sometimes sends a sentence alongside it. That
sentence describes what it is about to do, not what happened, so the tool
calls win: reading the sentence out and stopping would tell the person about
work that never ran.

Offering no tools sends no `tools` field rather than an empty array. An empty
array tells the model something, and what it has been told is unclear.

A remembered exchange goes back as this endpoint matches it: the calls on an
assistant message, and each result as its own message carrying the identifier
of the call it answers. The outcome travels inside the result's text, because
the wire has nowhere else to put it and a result that reads as plain prose is
one the model will report as having worked.

### A tool is a shape, not a paragraph

Prose quality cannot be enforced and structure can, so a tool is described in
fixed parts: what it does, when to reach for it, when not to, and worked
examples. The descriptions that go wrong are the ones saying what a tool is
without saying when it applies, and the repair is always the same — the
description grows louder until it is shouting IMPORTANT at the model. Ulaa's
tab delegate does exactly that, and its sub-prompt then has to spell out that
identifiers need quotation marks. A place for "use when" is what makes the
shouting unnecessary.

Registration refuses a tool that cannot be described: no purpose, no use-when,
no channel, an argument with no description or no type, a required argument
the tool does not take. All of it is findable at startup, and finding it out
instead from a wrong answer costs far more.

The schema is a typed structure that renders itself as JSON Schema, rather
than a raw string. A malformed schema then cannot be written, and a test can
walk the properties to check every one is described.

### The channel is checked twice, and the refusal is spoken

`For` decides which tools the model is told about; `Call` decides which
actually run. That looks like the same check twice and is not: the first is a
prompt, and a prompt is not a boundary. A model that has been told wrongly,
that invents a name, or that repeats a call from earlier in a conversation
that arrived by another channel, is stopped by the second.

A refused tool says so rather than quietly doing nothing. Told nothing, a
model invents a reason for the failure, and it invents a plausible one. The
same is true of a name that does not exist, which is answered with the names
that do, so the model can correct itself instead of guessing again.

### A message is words, tool calls or tool results, and never two

A turn that calls a tool produces two more messages: the assistant asking for
it, and the answer coming back. Both are kept. A model given a result without
the call that produced it cannot tell what it looked up from what it guessed,
and a person reading the transcript cannot tell what was done on their behalf.

A message carries exactly one of the three. Carrying none is nothing worth
storing; carrying two makes a transcript that says one thing while the model
reads another, since an assistant that explains itself and acts in the same
breath gives the person words that may not describe what happened. Ulaa draws
the same line with `content?: never`.

An outcome is `ok`, `failed` or `partial`. Three rather than two, because the
middle one is where an assistant starts bluffing: four lights asked for, three
turned off, one unreachable. Told only success or failure a model reports
either "done" or "nothing happened", and both are untrue. A failure carries
the real error verbatim, for the same reason a provider failure does.

Two places already knew how to mangle this and had to be taught not to.
`ForModel` dropped any message with no words in it, which is every tool call.
It also joined consecutive messages from the same speaker, which would have
run a call into the prose beside it. And a window trimmed by size cuts from
the oldest end, which can take an assistant's tool calls away and leave the
answers behind them: a service rejects a result that answers nothing, so the
window now drops results whose call did not survive.

The payloads are JSON columns rather than tables. They are read and written
whole and never queried into, so a row per argument would buy nothing and cost
a join on every turn.

### A conversation names itself, and says so out loud

Every conversation was untitled, which made the listing useless and made
switching by voice impossible: there was nothing to say and nothing to match
against. So after the first complete exchange the model is asked for a label
of two to four words, once, and never over a name somebody chose by hand.

A model asked for a bare label decorates it anyway -- quotation marks, a full
stop, "Title:" in front. That is stripped rather than asked for again. An
answer that arrives as a sentence is refused outright: no name reads better in
a listing than an apology does, and it will not be asked twice.

Naming from the question alone was rejected. It labels a subject nobody has
answered yet, and that is often not what the conversation turns out to be
about.

### Announcing interrupts, so it waits

The server could only ever reply: something arrives, something goes back.
Speaking first is a separate capability and is built as one, `internal/
announce`, silent unless Home Assistant is configured. Naming a conversation
is its first use and the least of them; a timer that has finished is the same
machinery.

`assist_satellite.announce` interrupts. Home Assistant drops whatever the
satellite is playing and says the new thing instead, so an announcement
following an answer cuts the answer off part-way. It was found the way such
things are: a recitation stopped dead so the assistant could say what it had
named the conversation.

The satellite reports what it is doing, and `TTS_START` leaves it responding
until the audio finishes, so announcing now waits for idle first. A satellite
that never falls quiet is left alone and the announcement is dropped, which is
the right outcome for anything incidental.

Idle is not the end, though. The state flips when the satellite stops feeding
the speaker, so an announcement sent the moment it reads idle lands on the
tail of the last sentence and the two run together as one. It now waits a
further second of quiet, and reads the state again afterwards: speech
starting during that second means the gap never happened, so the wait begins
again. A held second is the difference between two things said and one long
one.

`Settle`, defaulting to `DefaultSettle`. Negative restores announcing on the
first idle reading, which is what every test that is not about the pause
passes -- a suite that spends a second a case proving something else stops
being run.

### A request says why it is being made

`Purpose` marks a request as the person's question, or as the assistant's own
housekeeping. Nothing downstream could tell them apart, which surfaced as two
tests asserting on "the last prompt the model was given" and getting the
naming prompt that arrived after the answer. It is also how housekeeping could
one day go to a cheaper model than the one answering.

### The manner is held in memory and stored beside it

It is read on every prompt, so it lives in memory; it is expected to still be
chosen tomorrow, so it is written to a table. The in-memory copy is a cache of
a stored choice, not the choice itself.

A table of name and value rather than a column. There is no row the manner
belongs to: not the user's, since the same assistant answers whoever asks, and
not the client's, since it is the same assistant at every one of them. Which
model answers is the opposite case and stays on the client, because a spoken
answer has to arrive before the satellite gives up waiting.

Configuration gives the manner to start in the first time; once something has
been chosen the stored choice wins. A database that will not answer at startup
is not a reason to refuse to start, so the configured manner is used and
logged.

The write happens after the change is applied, not before. What answers is the
copy in memory, and a failed write should not leave the assistant speaking in
a manner nobody chose — it costs the choice its permanence and nothing else,
so it is logged rather than returned.

### A manner is behaviour, not adjectives

The personas are written from what the films show rather than from the words
usually attached to the characters. A model told to be witty is insufferable;
one told to report a disaster as a mild inconvenience is funny by itself. So
the instruction is never "be dry" but "understatement is the whole of your
humour", and never "be helpful" but "you do not refuse, and you do not
lecture".

The most widely copied Jarvis prompt online would break this assistant. It
asks for bullet points, a polite greeting, anticipated follow-up questions and
step-by-step reasoning. Read aloud, the first three are noise and the third
ends on a question mark, which is the character Home Assistant reads to decide
whether to keep the microphone open.

So the spoken rules are appended after the manner and say they win: where a
persona would ask permission it states its intent instead. Jarvis asked to
deploy something untested answers "That is unwise, sir, and I would run it
against a staging environment first. I will prepare the deployment as
directed" — disapproving, not refusing, and not ending on a question.

"Address the person as sir, at most once and often not at all" was read as
permission never to say it, and neither character used its form of address at
all. It is now a habit with a bound rather than a licence.

Each persona is also told not to act out a role and never to name the films,
which is what keeps a manner from becoming an impression of one.

### Package names follow the reference implementation

`catalog` becomes `llm` and `provider` becomes `environment`, matching the
services in the assistant this one borrows its model from. An `Environment` is
one configured place to send a prompt: an endpoint, its credentials, the wire
format it speaks and the model behind it.

`failure` stays as it is. Go will not have a package called `error`: importing
one binds that name in file scope, which shadows the predeclared type, and
every file that imports it then fails on `func f() error` with "error is not a
type". Aliasing each import would work and would mean the package is never
called by its own name anywhere, which is not a rename.

The `[provider]` section of the configuration keeps its name. Renaming a key
in a file the server reads does not fail loudly: the section is simply not
found, and the server falls back to the stub without an answer as to why.

### Two endpoints, two shapes of failure

A failure carries the exact error so that the model can be asked what went
wrong and answer truthfully. That only works if the exact error survives, and
for one of the two endpoints it did not.

The chat endpoint nests its message, `{"error": {"message": ...}}`. The token
endpoint puts a string where the other puts an object,
`{"error": "Access Denied", "error_description": ...}`. Reading only the first
shape made the unmarshal fail on the type, which was taken to mean there was
no message, and the conversation recorded "token response was not usable"
instead of "You have made too many requests continuously."

One of those tells a person to wait and the other tells them nothing. Both
shapes are read now.

### A vendor an endpoint speaks to is not a model it routes

### The settings page says what it means

"Server default" named nothing, so the listing carries the identifier of the
model that answers when a client has chosen none, and the field reads as that
model's name.

The channel and the model are the same kind of choice — one of a short list,
worth reading before picking — so they are the same control, each under a
label. Two bare words side by side said neither what they were nor that they
could be changed. A client cannot raise its own channel, so on the current
client that field is locked with the reason in the menu rather than offered
and then refused.

"this one" becomes "you are signed in here".

The model picker first offered every model whose vendor the endpoint reaches.
That inference is wrong, and wrong in the direction that breaks things: this
endpoint talks to Anthropic and refuses `claude-haiku-4-5`, while answering
happily to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, which is the same model under its
dated name. It rejects Google as a vendor outright. Choosing a refused model
left that client failing every prompt afterwards, which is how it was found —
by breaking voice.

So the endpoint names the models it answers with, one by one, and the
catalogue says what each one holds. Neither list knows the other; they are
joined on vendor and identifier, and a test fails if a routed model is not
catalogued, because the join would otherwise drop it in silence.

Every entry was verified by asking the endpoint through the real provider
code. Doing that with curl gave 401s, since a handmade request is missing
whatever the client sends; driving the provider itself was both easier and
the only way to test what actually runs. One model reported rejected on the
first attempt and answered on the second, the first failure having been in
minting the token rather than in the model. One probe is not proof.

### A session is a conversation

Migration 00007 renamed conversations to sessions. This renames them back,
because the word has since been taken: everywhere else in this field a session
is one exchange with a service, a single call and its reply. Ulaa's
`SessionContext` is exactly that. What this holds is a thread of talk that
outlives any number of those.

It went all the way: the package, the types, the tables, the columns, the
indexes, the routes, and the `sess_` prefix on every stored identifier. A
conversation identified by `sess_` would be the kind of detail that is
puzzling a year later, and both prefixes are five characters so nothing had to
be widened.

Two words were not ours and had to be put back after the rewrite:
`@@session.time_zone`, which is MySQL's, and `session_token` in the log
redaction list, which is the web's. The second would have stopped a real
session token being redacted, so the rename would have quietly removed a
protection. Sweeping a word out of a codebase catches the places it means
something else, and those are found by reading the diff rather than by the
compiler.

The Down blocks of every migration here are documentation: nothing runs them
and no test exercises them. This one is the most involved of them, since it
drops constraints, renames, rewrites identifiers and rebuilds indexes.

### A client chooses its model

The model was configuration, so everything got the same one. What suits one
client does not suit another: a spoken answer has to reach the satellite
before it stops waiting, while a browser can wait for something slower and
better.

Per client rather than per account, because the client is the thing the
difference belongs to, and because it is already loaded on every request to
authenticate it. Per session was the alternative and is more flexible, but
voice creates sessions implicitly and would always land on a default.

The choice is copied onto the chat when it is accepted rather than read back
from the client when it runs. A chat recovered after a restart then goes to
the model it was accepted for, and a listing says which model answered rather
than which one that client would use today.

A client may set its own model, unlike its channel. The channel decides what
the assistant may do about a prompt, so a client raising it would grant itself
privileges; which model answers grants nothing, and the client you are sitting
at is the obvious place to change it from.

Only models the configured provider can reach are offered, and setting one it
cannot is refused. A model that cannot be called is a setting that breaks
every later prompt from that client, and it would break them at the moment
somebody speaks rather than at the moment the mistake is made.

### Each ceiling comes from whatever knows it

The three limits are declared in three places, because three different things
know them:

| ceiling | declared by | why there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100 messages | `platformai.MaxMessages` | a property of that endpoint's array |
| context window | `internal/catalog` | a property of the model, not the endpoint |
| 60,000 bytes | `session.DefaultBudget` | what we are willing to spend |

The catalogue is a list of models with what is known about each. The same
model reached through two endpoints has the same window, and two models behind
one endpoint do not, so the window cannot live with the provider. A model
missing from the list declares nothing and is logged; the byte budget then
governs alone, which is the safe direction.

Condensing starts at ninety-five percent of whichever ceiling is nearest and
leaves forty-five messages as they were said. The gap left above the trigger
is room for condensing to fail two or three times without overrunning.

`Plan` caps the history at one below the message limit. The prompt is added to
the array after the history is chosen, so a history filled to the limit is one
message too many on the wire — which is a failure the service reports as
`ARRAY_SIZE_OUT_OF_RANGE` and nothing here would have explained.

In practice the count is what binds. A spoken turn is a few dozen bytes, so a
hundred of them reach the message limit at a twentieth of the byte budget.

### A stopped turn is drawn as stopped

The server records an interruption as a message of its own and leaves any
partial answer beside it. The client rendered neither: it drew the answer, and
a cancelled chat has no answer and no error, so the turn came out as an empty
bubble under the word Assistant.

A turn whose status is cancelled now says so. Whatever was said before the
stop is still shown, with the note under it; a turn stopped before it said
anything shows the note alone. Nothing is hidden, because a turn that happened
should read as having happened.

### The summary is the session's, and the transcript is untouched

The condensation lives on the session as `summary` and
`summarised_through_seq`, not as a message. Nobody said it, so putting it in
the transcript would mean hiding it from the person, giving it a position in
a sequence it was never spoken in, and superseding one message with another
every time it is rewritten. As a column it is plainly derived: droppable,
rebuildable, and it leaves `messages` a record of what was actually said.

Condensing runs after the turn is recorded and announced, never before the
next one. The person is waiting on the answer, not on the housekeeping, and on
voice a summariser in front of the reply would be heard as the assistant
hanging. It still holds the runner's slot, so it competes with nothing.

Every failure in it is logged and dropped. A summary that could not be written
costs the next turn its oldest context and nothing else, and the turn after
tries again.

The provider is given the summary as `Request.Summary`, not as a leading
`Turn`. Where it belongs in a request is the provider's business: this one
has a field for the system prompt and it goes there, while a service without
one would render it as a leading system message.

### Three ceilings, and condensing before any of them is reached

A long conversation used to lose its early half in silence: the history was
held to sixty thousand bytes and the oldest messages fell off the front.
Nothing broke, which was the problem — the assistant simply forgot the
morning.

Three separate things cap a history, and they come from three places:

| ceiling | belongs to | who knows it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| message count | the wire format | the adapter for that service |
| context window | the model behind the service | the provider |
| byte budget | us | configuration |

They are kept as one `session.Limits` and all of them hold at once. The count
is what Ulaa hard-codes as `slice(-100)` inside its platform-AI format; ours
stays a declared number so a service without that cap is not held to someone
else's. The context window is converted to bytes at four bytes a token, which
is an approximation the reserve is sized to absorb; counting exactly needs the
model's own tokeniser, and being wrong by a little is what the reserve is for.

`Due` reports when the earliest part should be condensed — at ninety percent
of whichever ceiling is nearest, not when one is hit. `Plan` then sends the
summary in place of what it covers. The boundary between them is moved back to
the start of a turn, so a question is never condensed apart from its answer;
once a tool call and its result are messages, the same rule is what keeps a
result from being sent without the call that asked for it.

Ulaa clips instead and repairs the damage afterwards — dropping messages until
the first is a user's, collapsing the same speaker twice in a row, choosing
between two adjacent tool results by matching ids against the last tool call.
Choosing the boundary correctly is cheaper than mending it.

### A message has an identifier, and a position

`(session_id, seq)` was the key. It is unique and stable while the table is
only appended to, and stops being an identity the moment anything edits or
removes a message part-way through a session: seq is a position, and positions
move. Editing a turn and re-running from it is why this is wanted, and the
reference has to survive it.

So `id` names the message and `seq` orders it, unique within a session. The
constructors set the identifier; `Append` fills one in when a message was built
as a literal, before validating, so a caller does not have to know which fields
the store supplies.

Rows written before the column got a synthesised identifier rather than a real
ULID, because SQL cannot make one. SHA2 is hexadecimal and every hex character
is in the Crockford alphabet a ULID uses, so they are the right shape and
stable per message; they are not sortable by time, and nothing relies on that
because ordering is `seq`.

### A stopped turn is marked, not erased

Saying "stop" cancels the turn. What stays behind is the question, whatever
the assistant managed to say, and a message recording that the person stopped
it — `session.Interruption`, written as the assistant's own turn so the roles
still alternate.

Deleting the question instead would be simpler, and while a turn is only ever
text it would also be harmless: nothing happened, so nothing is lost. That
stops being true the moment a turn can act. Half a chain of tool calls may
already have run and left its effects behind, and a history with the request
removed leaves the model contradicting a world it changed.

So this is the one thing the model is told about that a `Failure` never is.
A failure read back as conversation becomes the model explaining an outage it
had no part in; an interruption read back is a fact about the conversation
that the next turn needs.

### Comments

Follow Go doc comment convention.

- Every exported type, function, constant, method and non-obvious struct field
  carries a doc comment. So does an unexported one whose purpose is not
  evident from its name.
- A doc comment begins with the identifier's name, then a colon, then the
  description:

  ```go
  // Open : Connects to MySQL, configures the pool and verifies the
  // connection. The caller must Close the returned DB.
  func Open(...) (*DB, error)

  // DB : An open database handle wrapping a *gorm.DB.
  type DB struct {
      // sqlDB : The underlying pool, kept for Ping and Stats.
      sqlDB *sql.DB
  }
  ```

  The word after the colon is capitalised, and the text is a description in
  its own right rather than a continuation of a sentence begun by the name.
  Write `// Redacted : The placeholder substituted for a redacted value.`, not
  `// Redacted : is the placeholder...`.
- Comments describe what the code is and does. They do not narrate how a
  decision was reached, what was considered and rejected, or what was asked
  for. That history belongs in commit messages and in this file, where it can
  be looked up deliberately.
- Keep them short. A one-line `// why` above a genuinely non-obvious statement
  earns its place; a paragraph of reasoning does not.

The reader of a comment has the file in front of them and none of the
surrounding session.

### Time

UTC everywhere — in Go, in MySQL sessions, in stored columns. The development
machine is in IST, so a bug here will not be visible locally until it is
visible in production.

### Identifiers

Prefer ULIDs over random UUIDs for anything time-ordered. They sort by creation
time, so history comes back ordered from an index scan without a sort.

---

## 6. Chats

The design agreed before any of it was built. Not yet implemented.

### Shape of the API

A request is a chat. Submitting one returns immediately; the work continues in
the background.

```
POST /v1/chats            {"prompt": "..."}   -> 202, the chat with id and status
POST /v1/chats?wait=30s                       -> holds the connection up to 30s,
                                                 returning the finished chat if it
                                                 lands in time, else the pending one
GET  /v1/chats/{id}                           -> the chat, with its response once done
GET  /v1/chats                                -> recent chats, without response bodies
POST /v1/chats/{id}/cancel                    -> stops a chat that has not finished
```

`wait` is a convenience for testing by hand, not a second execution mode. The
chat is created and run the same way either way.

### States

```
pending ──→ running ──→ completed
   │           ├──────→ failed
   └───────────┴──────→ cancelled
```

`completed`, `failed` and `cancelled` are terminal; nothing moves a chat out
of them. `waiting_approval` joins this set when tools need permission.

### Model

Implemented in `internal/chat`.

```go
type Chat struct {
    ID     string   // "chat_" + ULID
    Prompt string

    Status   Status
    Response string  // set when completed
    Error    string  // set when failed, written for a user to read

    CreatedAt  time.Time
    UpdatedAt  time.Time
    StartedAt  *time.Time  // nil until it runs
    FinishedAt *time.Time  // nil until terminal
}
```

`StartedAt` and `FinishedAt` are pointers because "has not started" is a
different fact from "started at the zero time".

```sql
CREATE TABLE chats (
  id          CHAR(31)    NOT NULL,   -- 'chat_' + 26-char ULID
  prompt      TEXT        NOT NULL,
  status      VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  response    MEDIUMTEXT  NULL,
  error       TEXT        NULL,
  created_at  DATETIME(3) NOT NULL,
  updated_at  DATETIME(3) NOT NULL,
  started_at  DATETIME(3) NULL,
  finished_at DATETIME(3) NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  KEY idx_chats_status_created (status, created_at)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

`DATETIME(3)` keeps milliseconds, which plain `DATETIME` truncates away.

Timestamps set by the domain are truncated to `chat.StoredPrecision`, which is
one millisecond, before they are stored. Go clocks to the nanosecond and MySQL
rounds a `DATETIME(3)` to the millisecond, so without this a chat in memory
stops matching the row just written from it, and every later comparison between
the two is quietly wrong. Truncating rather than rounding means the value the
domain holds is exactly the value that will be stored. The cost is that a chat
beginning and finishing within the same millisecond reports no duration, which
no real chat does. The
identifier is stored with its prefix and readable, rather than as a `BINARY(16)`
ULID, so the table can be read directly during development. A ULID primary key
already orders by creation time, so listing needs no sort. The secondary index
serves the runner's query, oldest pending first.

Deliberately absent until something needs them: `user_id`, the model used,
token counts, retry counts.

### Users, clients, sessions, chats

```
user                    the person the assistant belongs to
  |
  +-- clients           chrome, postman, a command line, a phone, a speaker
  |                     a token and nothing else: owns nothing,
  |                     but holds which session IT is in
  |
  +-- sessions          owned by the person, reachable from any client
        |
        +-- chats       a prompt is a chat
              |
              +-- messages
```

**A client is one logged-in thing, not a piece of hardware.** A laptop running
a browser, Postman and a command line is three clients. That is the useful
unit: each has its own token, so Postman's can be revoked without disturbing
the browser, and each has its own active session, so testing in one does not
interrupt a conversation in the other.

**Sessions belong to the user, not the client.** An exchange begun on a phone
continues at a desk. Every client sees every session.

**The active session belongs to the client.** A person may be speaking to a
speaker in one room while typing at a laptop in another, and those threads
must not collide. Switching on one client leaves the others where they were.
Which sessions exist is a property of the person; which one a client is
currently in is a property of the client.

**The user is the boundary.** Every ownership check asks whether it is the
same user, never the same client. A client is only which credential was
presented.

Naming a session on a single prompt sends it there without switching what the
client is in.

### Authentication

A client authenticates with a token, sent as `Authorization: Bearer fri_...`.
The token both names the client and proves it, so nothing is sent alongside:
an identifier presentable without the token would be a name with no password.

**Logging in and registering a client are one act.** `POST /v1/auth/login`
takes a username, a password and a client name, and returns a token. A token
exists only for a client, and a client may be created only by someone who
proved who they are, so there is nothing to register separately and no
registration secret to share around.

The token is returned once and never again, because only its SHA-256 is
stored. A plain hash rather than a password hash, since the token is 256 bits
of randomness: there is no dictionary to try, and bcrypt on every request
would cost a hundred milliseconds to defend against nothing.

**Passwords are bcrypt**, at a cost chosen so one check takes roughly two
hundred milliseconds. A password is chosen by a person and therefore
guessable, so here the slowness is precisely the point. `auth.PasswordCost`
exists so tests can lower it; production must leave it alone.

An unknown username spends the same time as a wrong password, through
`DummyPasswordCheck`. Answering faster for an account that does not exist
tells whoever is guessing which usernames are real.

`DELETE /v1/clients/{id}` revokes any of the caller's own clients, which is
the reason clients exist apart from the user: a phone left in a taxi is
revoked from the laptop at home. The row is kept rather than deleted, so a
revocation is visible in a listing.

Every refusal reads alike and answers 401. A token never issued and one since
revoked are logged apart, so a problem stays diagnosable, but answered
identically, so neither is discoverable.

**The first user is created from the terminal**, with `personal-assistant createuser
<username>`. There is no endpoint. One that creates the first user must either
be open, which lets a stranger claim the assistant, or be guarded by a shared
secret, which is the same problem one level up. A command run by whoever
already has the machine avoids both and is needed exactly once.

**A bearer token is only as private as the connection carrying it.** Over
plain HTTP anyone on the network reads it and becomes that client. TLS must
sit in front of the assistant before it is reachable from anywhere but the machine it
runs on.

### Sessions

A chat belongs to a session, and the provider is given what was said
earlier in it. Without that, a second prompt arrives with nothing before it:
"no, make it four" reached the model with nothing to make four, and it said so.

`POST /v1/chats` creates a session when the caller names none, and returns
its identifier so a follow-up can continue it.

**A new prompt supersedes whatever is still running in that session.**
Someone who speaks over an answer wants the new thing rather than both, and two
answers cannot be listened to at once. The superseded chat is cancelled, not
deleted: everything it said is still stored, it is simply never spoken.

**A cancelled chat still contributes its prompt to history.** This is what makes
a correction work at all. The question being corrected was cancelled the instant
the correction arrived, so a history of only completed chats would omit the very
thing the correction refers to.

Consecutive turns by the same speaker are joined into one. A cancelled chat
contributes a prompt with no answer, so two questions can end up adjacent, and
models that require alternating roles reject that. Joining also reads correctly:
a question followed by its correction becomes a single request.

### A chat, not a task

The owner's words: *"i mena tere shoudn ot be any task word..if i ask its a
chat..for a chat i get response"*. Migration `00009` renames `tasks` to
`chats`, `internal/task` is `internal/chat`, `/v1/tasks` is `/v1/chats`, and
identifiers begin `chat_` instead of `task_` — the same length, so no column
changed width.

`task_messages` became **`chat_updates`**, not `chat_messages`. `messages` is
now the conversation itself, and two tables a letter apart holding entirely
different things is a trap worth spending a better name on.

One caveat was raised before the rename and overruled, and it is recorded
because it will come due. A chat is one prompt through to one answer, which
today is exactly one call to the provider — but Ulaa's `runLLMSession` makes
*several* `/chat` calls when tools are involved, looping until the model
answers with text instead of a tool call. When the assistant grows tools, one chat
will contain several chat calls. The outer thing is what carries the status,
the cancel, the supersede rule and the stream; the inner one is
`platformai.attemptChat` and is not stored.

Two constraint names still predate all this — `fk_devices_user` and
`fk_conversations_user`, from before clients and sessions were renamed. They
are invisible except in `information_schema` and were left alone rather than
widening this change.

### The conversation is a log, not a by-product

Until now a session's history was read back out of the `chats` table: one turn
from the `prompt` column, one from `response`. That works only while every
exchange is exactly one question and one answer. There was nowhere to put a
failure the user had already seen, and nowhere for the shape to grow.

The owner asked for the shape used in `ulaa-ai-assistant`
(`src/background/services/conversation`), having read it: *"see how llms
adapters, conerstation are naintainer.,tht how i wnat my derver to be"*. Three
things were taken from it and one was left behind.

**Taken: messages are the stored unit.** `internal/session` holds a `Message`
with a `Role` and a `Kind`, and the `messages` table is a log per session with
a position assigned on insert. Chats remain the unit of work; they are no
longer the unit of record.

**Taken: one store, two views.** `ForModel` is what a provider is given,
`ForPerson` is what a person is shown. They differ today only in that failures
are withheld from the model, but they are separate functions because they
answer separate questions, and only one may change when a provider demands
something.

**Taken: a failure is a message.** the assistant could not answer, the person watched
it happen, and their next sentence refers to it — so it is in the log and on
the screen. It is never sent to a model: read back as conversation it becomes
the model explaining an outage it had no part in, and inventing detail to fill
the gap.

**Left behind: tool calls.** The owner's instruction was *"don think about
tool cals now"*, so there is no `tool` role and no `tool_calls` column. Adding
them later is a migration, which is the right price for not guessing their
shape now.

**Left behind: the vocabulary of chats.** Also the owner's: *"actually no need
for the term chat"*. The log is `internal/session`, keyed by session, with no
`chat_id` column — a message does not record which request produced it. The
existing `chats` table, `/v1/chats` and the runner keep their names; whether
those are renamed too is still open.

**How a question stays out of its own history.** The runner appends the
question, gets its position back, and reads everything *before* that position.
There is no identifier to exclude and no ordering to get right — the question
cannot reach the model twice by construction.
`TestTheQuestionIsNotAlsoInItsOwnHistory` fails without it; checked by
breaking it.

**Positions are assigned by reading the maximum and retrying.** Two appends to
one session can choose the same position; the loser is refused by the primary
key and takes the one the winner just claimed.
`TestConcurrentAppendsGetDistinctPositions` runs five at once against real
MySQL.

Migration `00008` carries existing history across, so upgrading a running
The assistant loses nothing: each finished chat contributes its question, then the
answer or the failure it ended in, ordered by identifier — a ULID, so by time.
On the development database that turned 511 chats into 688 messages.

**The whole session is sent.** The owner's words: *"i dont think the full
conversation is sent to platform ai..it shoudl include all messages ..mine
fridya's"*. A person expects an assistant to remember what they said this
morning.

What replaced the old twenty-turn cap is a byte budget,
`session.DefaultBudget`, sixty thousand bytes — roughly fifteen
thousand tokens, a long day of talking. A budget rather than a turn count
because what costs money and eventually exceeds the model's context is the
text, not the number of times the speaker changed. The oldest turns are dropped
first; a single turn longer than the whole budget is cut rather than dropped,
since dropping it would leave the model answering about a subject it never saw.

**No time is sent with a message, and this was tried.** The same request asked
for the date and time of every message, so each one went out as
`[Mon 22 Sep 2026, 2:32 pm IST] what was said`, with a paragraph appended to
the system prompt explaining that the brackets were context and were never to
be read back.

The model read them back. An answer about Iron Man arrived beginning
`[Tue 22 Sep 2026, 4:17 pm IST] Iron Man is one of the most iconic
superheroes...` — the convention was demonstrated on every single message, and
demonstration beats instruction. The owner's ruling: *"time shou niot be sent
to ai"*.

So nothing decorates a message on its way out: `provider.Turn` is a role and
text, and the system prompt is exactly what was configured.
`TestMessagesReachTheModelUnadorned` and the `[`-prefix check in
`TestHistoryCarriesBothSpeakers` are what keep it that way.

Times are still recorded — `messages.created_at`, in UTC — because they are
worth having and cost nothing. They just do not reach a model. Anything that
wants to answer a question about *when* will have to put the time somewhere a
model cannot mistake for a pattern to copy, which is a different design and
not this one.

### Running a chat

`internal/runner` owns execution. Two details of it are load-bearing.

A chat's lifetime is **not** derived from the request that submitted it. An
HTTP request's context ends when its response is sent, which would cancel the
chat at the moment the caller was told it had started. The runner holds its own
context instead.

The final write uses a context that **outlives the run**, via
`context.WithoutCancel`. Recording that a chat was cancelled is itself a
database write, and a cancelled context cannot make one, so a naive
implementation leaves cancelled chats stuck reading `running` forever.

Concurrency is capped. A chat waits for a slot before it starts, so a queued
chat stays `pending` rather than appearing to run while it waits.

A transient message that cannot be stored is logged and the run continues. The
answer is what matters; losing a line of progress is not worth discarding it.

### Consequences of chats being long-running

- **Startup recovers orphans.** A process that dies mid-chat leaves a row
  reading `running` that nothing will ever move. At startup every `running`
  chat is failed with an explanation, which is exact while the assistant is a single
  process. More than one process would instead need a `heartbeat_at` column
  and a reaper for stale rows.
- **A chat has a deadline.** Past a maximum duration the runner cancels it and
  records the failure, so a wedged call cannot occupy a slot indefinitely.

### Consequences of responses being large

- **Reads come in two shapes.** One selects the small columns, for listing and
  for polling; one selects everything, for fetching a finished result. A plain
  `SELECT *` through GORM would drag every response body along with it.
- **`response` holds the final answer only.** Intermediate steps, tool calls
  and progress belong in a separate table, or the column becomes a transcript
  that grows and is paid for on every read.

### Providers

A chat is carried out by a provider: Claude, GPT, or another. Which one runs a
given chat is a routing decision; the chat does not care.

A provider run is a stream. It yields zero or more transient messages, then
exactly one final message or one error, then ends.

```
pending ──→ provider running ──────────────────────────→ ended
                 "Checking your merge requests…"    update
                 "Found 4, reading the diffs…"      update
                 "Here is what I found: …"          final
```

```go
// Kind : Whether a message is progress, the result, or a failure.
type Kind string

const (
    KindUpdate Kind = "update"  // transient; more will follow
    KindFinal  Kind = "final"   // the result; the stream ends
    KindError  Kind = "error"   // the run failed; the stream ends
)

type Message struct {
    Kind Kind
    Text string
    At   time.Time
}

type Provider interface {
    Name() string
    Run(ctx context.Context, req Request) (<-chan Message, error)
}
```

The contract is part of the interface: the provider owns the channel and
closes it, a stream ends after exactly one `final` or one `error`, and
cancelling the context ends the run. A final message completes the chat; an
error fails it. Cancellation is what will serve both `POST /chats/{id}/cancel`
and interrupting the assistant mid-sentence by voice.

A channel was chosen over an iterator because it is what a Go reader expects
and selects naturally against cancellation. The cost is that a caller must
drain the stream or cancel the context, or the provider's goroutine leaks;
that obligation belongs in the doc comment on Run.

The provider's own running and ended states are the lifetime of the stream and
are not stored. The chat's `running` and terminal statuses already record it.

### Transient messages are stored

They are not merely streamed. A client that reconnects mid-chat can catch up,
a finished chat can be asked what it said while working, and a poor answer can
be examined step by step. Streamed and forgotten, they are gone whenever
nobody happens to be listening, which with a voice client is most of the time.

```sql
CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
  chat_id    CHAR(31)    NOT NULL,
  seq        INT         NOT NULL,
  kind       VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
  text       MEDIUMTEXT  NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME(3) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (chat_id, seq),
  CONSTRAINT fk_chat_messages_chat
    FOREIGN KEY (chat_id) REFERENCES chats(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

The primary key orders a chat's messages and stores them together. The final
message is **not** duplicated here: it lives in `chats.response`, and an error
in `chats.error`, so a large answer is stored once. Replaying a run means
reading the messages and then the chat's own result.

`kind` is kept even though only updates are written today, because tool calls
and their results will be recorded the same way.

### Streaming to a client

`GET /v1/chats/{id}/stream` sends server-sent events. Every message a client
receives is one whole sentence, ready to be spoken.

The handler subscribes to the bus **before** reading the chat. Reading first
leaves a gap in which a chat can finish unheard, and the client then waits for
a message that was already sent. Having subscribed, it replays the messages
already stored, sends the outcome and closes if the chat has finished, and
otherwise follows the live stream, skipping anything it already replayed.

A client reconnecting sends `Last-Event-ID` and resumes from there, so a phone
on mobile data does not hear the same sentence twice.

Publishing never blocks. A client that has stopped reading loses events rather
than delaying the chat producing them; the database holds the durable record
either way. Comments are sent on an idle stream, because proxies and mobile
networks close a silent connection and a real agent will think for minutes
without speaking.

### The satellite is linux-voice-assistant, not wyoming-satellite

The microphone in front of Home Assistant is OHF-Voice's
`linux-voice-assistant`. It is the ESPHome satellite implementation running on
Linux -- the same code path the Home Assistant Voice PE hardware uses -- and it
reaches Home Assistant over the ESPHome API rather than Wyoming.

None of it lives in this repository. The satellite, the patches it and Home
Assistant need, and the switch that turns the stack on and off are tracked
separately in [voice-setup](https://github.com/DhanushRamesh/voice-setup),
cloned at `~/voice-setup`. That repository records which upstream versions the
patches were written against, because both edit upstream source by matching
exact text.

It replaced `wyoming-satellite`, which has since been removed. Wyoming needed
two patches inside its virtualenv and four shell scripts to do things this has
as settings: a pre-roll buffer so a wake word and a question can be one
sentence, a detector reset so it does not wake itself after every reply,
chimes, and microphone level management. Its wake word also had to be tuned
by hand, where MicroWakeWord reports 0.996 against a 0.900 threshold on the
same voice and microphone.

None of this improves recognition. Home Assistant's setup offers American and
British English and no Indian English, so speech-to-text remains the
unsolved part.

### Home Assistant talks to the assistant in Ollama's shape

Home Assistant reaches a language model through one of its integrations. Of
those built into it — `openai_conversation`, `anthropic`,
`google_generative_ai_conversation`, `ollama` — **only Ollama's asks for the
address of the server to call.** The others hardcode their vendor's endpoint.
Pointing the OpenAI one at the assistant would need `extended_openai_conversation`
from HACS, which is a community add-on and one more thing to keep working.

So the assistant answers in Ollama's shape, and `internal/api/assist` is that
translation:

```
GET  /api/tags   -> the one model, named "assistant"
POST /api/chat   -> a chat, answered as newline-delimited JSON
```

Both paths are fixed by the caller. The Ollama client appends them to the
address it was configured with, so they cannot be moved under `/v1` with the
rest of the API. `routes_test.go` records them for that reason.

Four things follow from the protocol being someone else's:

**Unknown fields are ignored, not refused.** Home Assistant sends `tools`,
`keep_alive`, `options`, `think` and `format`, all of which describe running a
model on the machine being called. `httpx.DecodeJSON` rejects fields a request
does not define, which is right for the assistant's own API and wrong here: a new
version of Home Assistant sending one more field would stop the assistant answering
at all. `assist` decodes with a plain decoder and says why.

**Authentication is the bearer token that already exists.** The Ollama
integration has an optional API key and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer`,
which is what `authn.Require` already reads. A `fri_` token pasted into that
box is the whole of the setup, and a wrong one gets a 401 that Home Assistant
reports as an authentication failure rather than a broken server.

**Home Assistant's copy of the conversation is discarded.** It sends the whole
exchange on every turn, including its own system prompt. The assistant keeps its own
log and builds a model's history from that, so only the last user turn is
taken. Using both would give one chat two disagreeing accounts of what was
said.

**The answer is streamed, and that is what makes long work possible.** The
connection is held open while the chat runs, so a chat taking two minutes
survives as long as it keeps saying something, and each transient message is
spoken as it arrives. An empty chunk every fifteen seconds keeps a silent chat
from having its connection closed underneath it. This is the same reason
The assistant's own clients are given a stream, and it is why `/api/chat` does not
reuse the 202-and-poll shape of `POST /v1/chats`.

One thing setup depends on: `GET /api/tags` must answer within five seconds,
because that is the timeout Home Assistant applies while validating the
configuration. Nothing slow belongs in it.

**An answer must not end in a question mark.** Home Assistant decides whether
to reopen the microphone from the last character of the reply, in
`conversation/chat_log.py`:

```python
last_msg.content.strip().endswith(("?", ";", "？"))
```

There is no setting for it. A closing "is there anything else?" therefore
leaves the satellite listening and makes the wake word unnecessary, which is
the opposite of how the owner wants to speak to it: the name is said every
time.

**A caller that hangs up has its chat cancelled.** This is the opposite of
the SSE stream, where a dropped connection is a phone on bad mobile data and
the answer has to still be there when it reconnects. Home Assistant never
reconnects: when it drops the request the turn is over, and leaving the chat
running would spend a provider call on an answer nobody can hear. It is also
what makes saying "stop" mid-question worth anything — the satellite abandons
the pipeline, Home Assistant drops the connection, and the assistant stops the work.

Two things guard against it. The system prompt asks for no closing question,
which also shortens replies that are being read aloud. That is a request, not
a guarantee — the model still offers help after a greeting — so
`assist.settled` turns a trailing question mark into a full stop before the
answer is sent. It belongs in `assist` rather than in the provider because it
is a property of Home Assistant's protocol, not of the assistant's answers, and no
other client cares.

### Platform AI

`internal/provider/platformai` answers using Zoho Platform AI, selected with
`[provider] name = platformai`. It was written from the working client in
`~/workspace/ulaa_defter/product_package/go_src/project_assistant`.

The service is request and response: one call returns one complete answer, with
nothing in between. The assistant's interface streams because a user listening through
earbuds needs to hear something long before the answer arrives, so this
provider produces its own progress: an acknowledgement at once, a reassurance
every fifteen seconds while the call is outstanding, then the reply as the
final message. Silence is the thing to avoid, not a shortage of detail.

The system prompt asks for plain spoken sentences and forbids markdown,
headings and code fences. They are noise when heard rather than read.

Three things about the service are easy to get wrong:

- The system prompt is sent in a field named `context`, not `content`.
- A reply's content arrives either as a plain string or as an array of blocks
  each carrying text, and both must be handled.
- An error envelope carries a message the service wrote to be read, so that
  reaches the user. Anything else — transport, decoding, an HTML error page —
  is reported in general terms, because it means nothing to a listener and can
  carry internal detail.

**Credentials must be scrubbed from transport errors.** The token endpoint
takes the client secret and refresh token as query parameters, and a
`*url.Error` carries the whole URL, so wrapping one as it comes writes the
credentials into the log in plain text. This happened and was fixed. Redaction
in `internal/logging` cannot catch it: that matches attribute keys, and this is
a secret buried inside an error's text. `scrubURL` removes the query string
while keeping the operation, host and cause.

**Use the public endpoints**, `accounts.zoho.com` and `platformai.zoho.com`.
They serve the same paths as the internal ones and are reachable from
anywhere, so the assistant can use this provider from a cloud host. The internal
addresses are reachable only from the corporate network and are not used.

Credentials are realm-specific. The ones issued on the internal accounts
domain are rejected with `invalid_client` against `accounts.zoho.com`; a
Self Client on api-console.zoho.com, with scope
`PlatformAI.organizations.all`, is what works. Certificate verification stays
on, since the public endpoints present ordinary certificates.

Credentials live in `config.ini`, which is git-ignored, or in
`ASSISTANT_PLATFORMAI_CLIENT_SECRET` and `ASSISTANT_PLATFORMAI_REFRESH_TOKEN`.

### A hand-built Transport loses every default

`http.DefaultTransport` sets `IdleConnTimeout` to ninety seconds. A
`&http.Transport{}` written out to set one field gets zero for the rest,
and zero there means keep idle connections for ever. One kept past the
far end's own idle timeout is dead, and the next request down it fails
with EOF before anything can answer.

That is what lost a turn: thirty-five seconds of quiet, then a POST that
ended in eighty-two milliseconds. The first of its kind in the log, which
fits -- it needs the other end to drop a connection during an idle gap.

So the Transport now also sets `IdleConnTimeout`, a dialer keep-alive and
`Proxy: http.ProxyFromEnvironment`. The last changes nothing today, since
no proxy variables are set, and silently bypassing a proxy is not a thing
to leave waiting to be discovered.

That narrows the window rather than closing it: the far end can close a
connection at any instant, and Go will not retry a POST by itself. So a
call that fails with the connection gone is made once more. It is safe
exactly because nothing was asked -- no tool ran, the model was never
reached -- and it is told apart from an answer by the error, since an
answer of any kind, refusal included, means the request arrived. Once
only: a service that is down would otherwise be asked twice a turn, and
double the wait before anybody is told.

### A refused token renews itself

An access token can be refused before it was believed to have expired.
Zoho invalidates one when another is issued for the same client, so
authorising from anywhere else — or a second copy of the assistant running —
revokes ours silently, long before the expiry that was calculated from
`expires_in`.

A 401 therefore drops the cached token, mints a fresh one and repeats the
call. **Once only**: a refresh token that has itself been revoked would
answer every attempt the same way, and retrying for ever would hang the
chat rather than fail it.

**A machine code is never read aloud.** The service's own wording is
passed on because it was written to be read, but `INVALID_OAUTHTOKEN` was
not — it is for whoever runs the server, and means nothing spoken to
somebody waiting for an answer. A message shaped like a code
(SHOUTING_SNAKE_CASE, no spaces) is replaced by one that says what is
actually wrong; a message shaped like a sentence is passed through
unchanged, since it is usually more informative than anything substituted
for it.

### The first provider is a stub

Implemented in `internal/provider`.

It emits a couple of fixed updates and a final message. That makes the whole
pipeline visible end to end with no API key and no network, so the chat
lifecycle, cancellation and streaming can be debugged on their own. A real
provider then replaces it behind the same interface without anything else
changing.

## 7. Configuration

Three layers, each overriding the one before:

```
built-in defaults  <  config.ini  <  environment variables
```

Every key has an environment equivalent named `ASSISTANT_<SECTION>_<KEY>`. This is
how secrets reach a deployed machine without editing files.

- `config.ini` is **git-ignored**. Never commit it.
- `config.example.ini` is committed and must stay in step. A test loads it.
- Adding a setting means adding it to `config.go`, `config.example.ini`, and
  the table in `README.md`. Unknown keys in the file are a startup error, so
  an omission here breaks the example file's test.

---

## 8. Database

MySQL 8. Local development database and user are created by hand; see
`README.md`.

- Connections must set `parseTime=true`, `loc=UTC` and `time_zone='+00:00'`.
  Without these, `DATETIME` scans as `[]byte` and stored times drift.
- MySQL treats `'user'@'localhost'` and `'user'@'127.0.0.1'` as separate
  accounts. Create both for local development.
- Storage goes behind a repository interface so the engine stays swappable.

Migrations live in `internal/storage/migrations` as numbered `.sql` files and
are applied by `goose` used as a library. `embed.FS` compiles them into the
binary, so deployment stays a single file with no directory of SQL to keep
beside it.

`storage.Migrate` runs at startup when `[database] auto_migrate` is true, which
it is by default. goose records what it has applied, so running it on every
start does nothing when there is nothing to do.

Migrating takes an advisory lock, held on a dedicated connection because MySQL
scopes `GET_LOCK` to the connection that took it. Two processes starting
together would otherwise run the same migration at once, and MySQL does not
roll back DDL: the loser finds a table its own `CREATE` never recorded, and
fails on every start thereafter. This was not hypothetical — parallel test
packages sharing one database hit it.

GORM's `AutoMigrate` is **not** used and is not a substitute. It adds tables
and columns but never drops, renames or transforms, so a schema evolved with it
drifts from what a fresh database produces.

Adding a migration means a new numbered file. Existing files are never edited
once applied anywhere, because goose will not reapply them.

---

## 9. Environment notes

Facts about the owner's machine that have already caused confusion:

- MySQL `root` uses socket authentication. `mysql -u root -p` is refused; use
  `sudo mysql`. **`sudo` requires a password an agent does not have** — so any
  step needing root must be handed to the owner to run.
- The machine also runs a PostgreSQL 12 instance with an unrelated `sasdb`
  database. Leave it alone.
- Machine timezone is IST. MySQL's `time_zone` is `SYSTEM`.
- The `mysql` client reports `@@session.time_zone` as `SYSTEM` even when
  the assistant's own connections are UTC, because the client does not set the
  session variable. This is not a fault.

---

## 10. Current state

Keep this honest. An inaccurate status here is worse than none.

### How the pieces fit

Everything below the API layer is built and tested. `✅` is done, `⬜` is not.

  ->  storage.Migrate()  ✅  ->  chatmysql.NewRepository()  ✅
  ->  runner.New()       ✅  ->  runner.Recover()           ✅

```

A prompt submitted over HTTP is stored, answered by a real model through
Platform AI, and streamed back message by message. Verified against the live
service: a question asked over HTTP was answered by Claude in about three
seconds, with the acknowledgement heard immediately. The path a voice client
needs is complete, end to end.

**Built**

- `cmd/server` — chi server, graceful shutdown, `GET /health`, request logging,
  panic recovery
- `internal/logging` — structured logging, context-carried attributes,
  credential redaction, runtime-adjustable level
- `internal/config` — three-layer configuration, validation, secret handling,
  wired into the server
- `internal/storage` — MySQL connection through GORM, pool configuration,
  GORM logging routed into `internal/logging`, opened at startup
- `internal/api` — the HTTP interface, one package per resource under it;
  `api.go` assembles them and is the only place routes are registered
- `internal/chat` — the Chat type and its status state machine. Pure Go; it
  touches neither the database nor HTTP
- `internal/chat/memory` — an in-memory `chat.Repository`, so the runner and
  the API can be tested without MySQL. Real code rather than a test fixture,
  because two packages need it and a copy in each drifts apart
- `internal/provider` — the Provider interface, its message types, and the
  stub implementation. Pure Go; no network
- Migrations for `chats` and `chat_messages`, applied at startup
- `internal/chat/mysql` — the chat repository. The `Repository` interface is
  declared in `internal/chat`, which stays free of GORM; every mapping between
  a domain type and a row happens in the implementation beside it
- `internal/runner` — executes chats: reads a provider's stream, stores each
  transient message, records the result, and handles cancellation, deadlines
  and recovery of chats interrupted by a restart
- The chat API: create, fetch, list, read messages, cancel. `cmd/server` wires
  the repository and runner together, so a prompt submitted over HTTP is
  answered by the stub provider and stored
- `internal/events` — an in-process bus carrying a chat's messages from the
  runner to whoever is listening
- `internal/provider/platformai` — answers using Zoho Platform AI, selected by
  `[provider] name`
- `internal/auth` — token issuing and hashing, bcrypt password hashing, and
  the constant-time comparisons around both
- `internal/api/assist` — `/api/tags` and `/api/chat`, answering Home Assistant
  in the shape its Ollama integration expects. This is how a spoken question
  reaches the server now that the client is gone
- Users, their clients, and their sessions. A client authenticates with
  a bearer token and holds its own active session; chats land there,
  history reaches the provider, and a new prompt supersedes whatever is still
  running in that same session
- `GET /v1/chats/{id}/stream` — server-sent events, delivering each message as
  it is produced. This is the voice path
- `GET /health` (liveness, no dependencies) and `GET /ready` (checks the
  database, 503 when it is unreachable)

**Not built**
- Authentication. Every endpoint is open
- The Android client, tools, memory and the agent loop
- The chat API and the runner that executes chats
- Agent loop, tools, permissions, events
- Authentication
- Any client

**Known loose ends**

- `?wait` still polls the database. It is a convenience for using the API by
  hand; the stream is what a client should use, and could serve `?wait` too.
- The event bus is in-process. A second process would not see another's
  events, and clients would hear nothing from chats it was running.
- Nothing terminates TLS in development. The assistant binds the loopback and
  refuses a public interface in production, and `deployments/` puts Caddy in
  front, but locally it is plain HTTP and must stay on this machine.
- Tokens do not expire. Revocation is the only way to end one, which is the
  agreed trade for a handful of the owner's own clients.
- Platform AI's reassurance interval is fifteen seconds, and answers commonly
  arrive in three to nine, so most chats send only the opening
  acknowledgement. That is fine now, but if answers get slower the interval is
  worth shortening: silence is what to avoid when listening.
- the assistant refuses to start when the database is unreachable. That is deliberate
  for now, but means a database restart takes the server down with it.

## 11. Deploying

**The deployed machine is deliberately behind, and is not being touched.**
The owner has parked it: nothing is being deployed there for a while.

So it is still the old install in every respect. It runs the binary from
before the rename, out of `/opt/friday` as `friday.service` under the OS user
`friday`, against a `friday` database. It has none of the work that followed:
no `internal/api/assist`, so no `/api/tags` or `/api/chat`, so Home Assistant
cannot reach it. Voice works against a server running on the owner's laptop
instead.

Two things follow. The migration section in `deployments/README.md` is not
pending work waiting to be finished — it is there for whenever that machine
is next visited. And deploying is not one step: the rename has to happen
alongside it, because the unit, directory, user and database on that box no
longer match anything in this repository.

**the assistant binds the loopback and refuses a public interface in production.**

It speaks plain HTTP and its tokens are bearer credentials, so anyone who can
read one becomes that client. The default address is `127.0.0.1:8080` rather
than `:8080`, because the latter looks like localhost and binds everything —
the mistake is silent, which is why it is refused rather than warned about.
`[server] allow_public_bind` exists for when something else already terminates
TLS, and has to be set deliberately.

**Caddy owns the certificate.** It obtains one from Let's Encrypt on the first
request and renews it indefinitely, so there is no certbot and no expiry to
forget. Its configuration sets `flush_interval -1`, without which server-sent
events are buffered and a voice client hears nothing until the end.

**A hostname is required.** Let's Encrypt will not certify a bare address.
DuckDNS gives free subdomains that do not expire.

**The database is on the same machine**, not a managed free tier. Those cap at
around a gigabyte, and every prompt and answer is stored; a local database
also spares a network round trip on the history read that precedes every chat.
The cost is that backups are ours, which `deployments/backup.sh` and its timer
cover: nightly, fourteen days, written under a temporary name so a half-written
dump is never mistaken for a good one, and checked afterwards for the tables it
should contain. A backup that restores nothing is worse than none, because it
is trusted.

Two things that bit while writing it, both worth knowing:

- `mysqldump` reads `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES` unless given
  `--no-tablespaces`, which needs the server-wide `PROCESS` privilege. A
  backup user has no business holding that, so the flag is required rather
  than cosmetic.
- `grep -q` under `set -o pipefail` exits at the first match, kills the
  upstream `zcat` with SIGPIPE, and reports the pipeline as failed. A correct
  backup was declared corrupt by its own verification. Counting reads the
  whole stream and cannot do that.

## 12. Maintaining this file

When the owner states a preference, makes a decision, or corrects something,
**record it here** in the same turn. That is the point of the file: a fresh
agent on a different machine should be able to read it and behave consistently
with every session that came before.

Record the reasoning, not just the conclusion. A decision whose rationale is
lost gets reversed by the next person who thinks they know better.

Delete entries that become wrong. A stale instruction is followed just as
faithfully as a correct one.
